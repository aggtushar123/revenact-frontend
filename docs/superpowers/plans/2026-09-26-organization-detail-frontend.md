# The organisation page, frontend (delivery 1: the new page and the Story) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Rebuild `/organizations/:id` as the organization's story: the Organizations frame, a name row, four tiles, account chips, a real tablist (Story · Details · People · Deals & risks · Knowledge · Files), the Story (Needs attention, filters, Sources, search, + Add, a day-grouped stream that pages itself), Details on the List's six panels, today's People/Deals/Knowledge/Files content inside the new frame, and every removal in spec §1.10.

**Architecture:** Data lives in two small feature modules. `features/organizations/story*.ts` holds the §2 story contract (types, kinds, the API call, the day grouping) and `detailParams.ts` holds the page's URL state (`tab`, `account`, `group`, `source`, `q`). Presentational parts live in a new folder, `components/organizations/detail/`, beside `portfolio/`, whose `rowParts`, `AccountDetails`, `styles.ts`, `useEndSentinel`, `useDismiss` and section states they reuse. The page (`pages/organizations/Details.tsx`, rewritten) owns three reads: `useOrganization` (the portfolio row plus `/customers/{id}/`), the accounts (the existing `fetchAccountsForCustomer`) and `useStory` (the new endpoint, cursor-paged). It draws itself in `OrganizationsFrame` (no rail in delivery 1) under the Navbar's transparent top bar. "+ Add" reuses the existing create forms, lifted out of their tabs into a `Sheet`.

**Tech Stack:** React 19, TypeScript, react-router 7 (`useSearchParams`, `Link`), Redux Toolkit (the existing `customers`, `calls`, `files`, `knowledge`, `auth` slices), Tailwind v4 tokens, lucide-react, Vitest + Testing Library + user-event (jsdom).

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-organization-detail-design.md`. This plan covers §1 (page anatomy), §2 (the data it reads; the backend builds the story endpoint) and §4 delivery 1's frontend, with the frontend parts of §5. Ask on this page (§3) is delivery 3 and out of scope. The analysis behind the spec is `.superpowers/org-detail-analysis.md` (git-ignored scratch).

**Branch:** `feat/organization-detail` (it already exists and holds the spec). The companion backend PR (the story endpoint) merges and deploys first (spec §4).

## Global Constraints

- Header reads (spec §2): `GET /organizations/portfolio/?ids={id}&include_churned=1` (plus `limit=1`), which "gives one row with everything the List shows"; `ids` names archived rows too. `GET /customers/{id}/` adds `health_breakdown`, `csat_breakdown`, email, phone and industry.
- Accounts: `GET /customers/{id}/accounts/` gives the chips. "Their counts come from the story's `counts.by_account`."
- Story: `GET /api/v1/organizations/{id}/story/` (called as `/organizations/{id}/story/` through `apiFetch`, which prefixes `/api/v1`). **The backend is the source of truth** (`revenact-backend/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-26-organization-story-backend.md` and `services/organizations/story/` on `feat/organization-story`); Task 1 mirrors it. `IsAuthenticated`; an organisation outside `visible_customers` is a **404** (it does not confirm the organisation exists). Parameters: `group` ∈ {conversations, tickets, tasks, feedback, health}; `source` (comma list of exact kinds); `account` (a positive account id, or `none` for the organization's own records; an id outside this organization's accounts in scope reads nothing, not a 404); `q` (trimmed, at most 200 characters); `thread` (an email `thread_id`: that thread's emails only; it narrows `items`, never `counts` or `attention`); `cursor`; `limit` (default 30, max 100; below 1 reads as 30). "Unknown values are dropped, never a 400."
- Story response: `{items, next_cursor, counts: {by_group, by_kind, by_account}, attention}`. Each item is `{id, kind, source, occurred_at, all_day, account: {id, name} | null, title, summary, actor: {id: number | null, name} | null, link: {thread_id: string | null, url: string | null}}`. `by_group` (keys `all` and the five groups) and `by_kind` (every kind) follow `account` and `q` but not `group` or `source`; `by_account` (keys `all`, `none` and every in-scope account id as a string) follows `group`, `source` and `q` but not `account`. `attention` follows `account` only. The shapes are fixed in Task 1 (pre-flight 10).
- Paging: one keyset cursor over `(occurred_at, kind, id)`, opaque, `null` on the last page, passed back verbatim (URL-encoded). The cursor is bound to `group`, `source`, `account`, `q` and `thread`: a cursor cut under other filters, or a malformed one, reads as page one. The page reads 30 at a time (`STORY_PAGE_SIZE`).
- The story is what has happened: anything dated from tomorrow (UTC) on (an upcoming meeting, a future-dated ticket) is left out of items and counts. A task is in the story at its `created_at`, not its due date (overdue tasks are the attention block's job). Health items are month-end `HealthSnapshot` changes of health category, AI pulse or CSM pulse only; lifecycle changes are not stored and never appear.
- Privacy is the server's (the twice-filter): the page shows exactly what arrives. The anomaly's `title` is always a string; for a viewer who does not see everything the server withholds the real title and sends "Similar reports across 1 of your companies", which the page shows as it came.
- Existing endpoints stay for create and edit: `/customers/{id}/…` tasks, notes, surveys, calls; `PATCH /customers/{id}/` (edit, churn); `POST /organizations/bulk/` (archive); `/customers/{id}/accounts/` (add and edit an account).
- Delivery 1 has no Ask on this page: no rail, no ✦ pill, no "Ask Copilot" link. The Navbar renders its empty actions slot, as on the List before delivery 3.
- House rules (spec §1 and `.claude/skills/revenact-design/SKILL.md` §1 and §4):
  - Tokens only: no hex, `rgb(`, `text-white` or named palette colours in `.tsx`.
  - One monochrome primary (`bg-accent` with `text-on-accent`); semantic colour only for status. Numbers in `font-mono-brand tabular-nums`.
  - Type sizes **11/13/15/22 px only** inside `components/organizations/detail/` and in `pages/organizations/Details.tsx` (the house-rules scan, Task 3 and Task 16).
  - No card-in-card; **no glass**. Rows and panels are `bg-surface` items on the canvas.
  - Skeletons shaped like what they stand for. Designed empty and error states.
  - Hover, focus-visible (`FOCUS` from `portfolio/styles.ts`), active and disabled states throughout. 44px touch targets below `sm` (`min-h-11 sm:min-h-9`). Motion only through existing tokens; the global reduced-motion override covers `transition-*` and `animate-pulse`.
  - No third-party images (no Clearbit logo, no pravatar avatar): initials only.
- Copy: sentence case, no em dashes in new UI copy, "organization"/"organizations" (US spelling) in UI text.
- Phones are `< 640px` (`SM = '(min-width: 640px)'` from `src/lib/useMediaQuery.ts`). jsdom has no `matchMedia`, so **`useMediaQuery` reads false (phone) in tests unless `setViewport(1440)` from `src/test/viewport.ts` runs first**. The page reads `isSm` once and passes it down. A layout that exists on phones only or on desktop only (the tile strip vs the grid, the bottom sheet vs the side panel) is rendered conditionally on `isSm`, never only CSS-hidden.
- jsdom has no `IntersectionObserver` and no `Element.prototype.scrollIntoView`. The code guards both (`useEndSentinel` does nothing without an observer and Show more does the paging; every `scrollIntoView` call is `?.()`).
- Tests follow `.claude/skills/testing/SKILL.md`: unit, integration (real store and router, network mocked at `fetch` with §2-shaped bodies through `stubOrganizationPage`), and e2e in `src/e2e/`.
- Gates: `npm run lint` passes with 0 errors and no new warnings in touched files, `npx tsc -b --noEmit`, `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2`, and `npm run build`.
- Every commit ends with the line `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Do not push. Do not switch branches.

## Pre-flight: where the spec meets the code

| # | Spec says | Code today | Resolution in this plan |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Frame: the Organizations frame, a transparent top bar, `p-0`; the ✦ rail is delivery 3. | `/organizations/:id` is outside `OrganizationsAskLayout` (`App.tsx:203`). The Navbar draws a bordered 64px bar with a back chevron, a Clearbit logo and the uppercase name from `state.customers.selectedCustomer` (`Navbar.tsx:76-87, 270-288`). `DashboardLayout` pads `<main>`. | The route stays where it is. The page wraps itself in `OrganizationsFrame` (rail null). The Navbar gains `isOrgDetail` (`/^\/organizations\/\d+$/`): the framed transparent bar with a "‹ Organizations" link to `/organizations/list`, the empty actions slot and the bell, no avatar. Its old organization branch and the `selectedCustomer` read go. `DashboardLayout` adds the route to its `p-0` set (Task 17). |
| 2 | Header data: the portfolio row by `ids` plus `/customers/{id}/`. | `Details.tsx:58-65` fires six thunks into the global `customers` slice, and `ActivityFeed` fires eight more: about 15 requests. `parseInt('abc')` fetches `/customers/NaN/`. | `useOrganization(id, version)` (Task 4) fires both reads at once, keeps the old row on screen while a new version reloads, and says `notFound` when the portfolio returns no row for this viewer. A non-numeric id is not found with no request. Landing is exactly four requests: portfolio, customer, accounts, story. Every other tab reads when first opened. |
| 3 | Name row: initials avatar (no third-party logo), name, `owner · lifecycle · Touched Nd ago`, signal, Edit, ⋯ with Churn and Archive "gated as on the List". | The List offers Archive and Churn with no client-side capability check (the server applies its rules and reports each failure); Churn runs per account through `ChurnOrganizationModal`; Archive goes through `POST /organizations/bulk/`. | `OrganizationHeader` (Task 5) uses `row.initials`. ⋯ lists Archive unless the row is archived and Churn unless it has churned, and hides itself when neither applies. Archive confirms with `ConfirmDialog` and shows the server's failure reason there; Churn opens `ChurnOrganizationModal` for this one id. Edit opens `OrganizationFormModal` with the customer already read (disabled until it lands). |
| 4 | Tiles: Health (ring, trend, tap for the breakdown), ARR (customer's currency), Renewal (runway), Pulse (AI · CSM, dots, disagree). A tile jumps to its Details panel. Phones: a snapping strip. | `HealthPopover` exists, unused, as a fixed hover tooltip with an `rgba` shadow and 10-12px type. The portfolio row's `arr` is in the org currency; `details.commercial.arr_billed_at_account` is in the customer's own. | `HeaderTiles` (Task 6) reuses `HealthRing`, `TrendLine`, `RenewalRunway` and `PulsePair`. The Health tile toggles an inline `HealthBreakdown` (a token-only list of the five rubric components from `health_breakdown`). ARR shows `arr_billed_at_account` in `details.commercial.currency`. ARR, Renewal and Pulse jump to the Commercial, Contract timeline and Voice panels: the tab switches to Details and the panel scrolls into view and takes focus. From `sm` the tiles are a four-column grid; below it, a `snap-x` strip. |
| 5 | Pulse: the List's form; the blended "Account Pulse" is dropped. | `MetricsBanner` shows `account_pulse`; `PinnedAttributes` draws five fake teal dots. | Only `PulsePair` appears (tile), and the AI reason is in Details' Voice panel. Neither the banner nor the pinned panel survives the rewrite. |
| 6 | Account chips `All · <Account> <n>`, counts from `counts.by_account`, `?account=` in the URL; `account=none` means "Organisation". | Nothing names the `by_account` keys, or whether a count ignores the account filter. | The backend names them: `by_account` has `all` (the total), `none` (records on the organization itself) and one key per account in scope (its id as a string, 0 included); it follows `group`, `source` and `q` but ignores `account` (so every chip keeps its number while one is chosen). `by_group` (`all` plus the five groups) and `by_kind` follow `account` and `q` and ignore `group` and `source`. `AccountChips` (Task 7) shows All (`by_account.all`), each account (`by_account[id]`, 0 when absent, i.e. out of the viewer's scope) and an "Organization" chip when `none` has items or is chosen. |
| 7 | A chip filters Story, People and Deals & risks; delivery 2 turns People and Deals into list items "filtered by account". | `ContactsTab` and `PipelinesTab` have no account filter to take. | In delivery 1 the chips show on the Story tab only and filter only the story. `?account=` stays in the URL while other tabs are open, so delivery 2 can read it. |
| 8 | Six tabs; the Accounts tab is not among them. | The Accounts tab holds account Add/Edit (`AccountFormModal`), a banner, a spreadsheet table with dead controls and a drill to `/accounts/:id`, which falls back to mock data on refresh (spec §6). | The Accounts tab goes, but no account detail is lost (**owner's decision, 2026-09-26**). The chips stay on the Story tab as the filter; the chip row ends with **Add account** (`AccountFormModal` create, then the accounts reload) and, while an account chip is chosen, **Edit <account>** (`AccountFormModal` edit). The Details tab opens with an **Accounts** section (`AccountsSection`, Task 15): one list item per connected account, not a table, with its name linking to `/accounts/:id`, owner, domain, pulse dots, "AI n" with the AI label and the AI reason (every one a field `GET /customers/{id}/accounts/` serves; `Account` gains the served `ai_pulse_value`), Edit on each and Add account, with designed loading, error and empty states. `/accounts/:id` still falls back to mock data on refresh (spec §6); that page is its own work. |
| 9 | "Success Plans, Custom Objects and Canvases become tabs when built." | Custom Objects and Canvas List are real tabs today; `/accounts/:id` renders the same components. | They leave this page with the rest of the old tab bar. `CustomObjectsTab` and `CanvasListTab` stay in `components/shared/` for `/accounts/:id`. |
| 10 | §2 names the story fields but not their values. | The backend plan (`2026-09-26-organization-story-backend.md`) and its code on `feat/organization-story` (`services/organizations/story/params.py`, `cursor.py`, `items.py`, `health.py`, `scope.py`, `sources.py`, `build.py`) fix them; the code wins where the two differ. | Task 1 mirrors the backend exactly. `kind` ∈ {activity, calendar_event, call, email, health, note, survey, task, ticket} (a Call is its own kind, its `summary` is `Call.summary`); groups: conversations = activity, call, email, calendar_event; tickets = ticket; tasks = task, note; feedback = survey; health = health. `id` is the record's own pk (unique with `kind`). `source` is the provider in lower case: a connector's (`zendesk`, `jira`, `freshdesk`, `webhook`, `intercom`, `salesforce`, `hubspot`, `slack`, `gmail`, `ms_teams`, `zoom`, `github`, `figma`), a mailbox's (`google`, `microsoft`, `imap`), or `revenact` for anything logged in the app; the page names it with `sourceName`. `occurred_at` is always an ISO 8601 UTC timestamp; `all_day: true` marks a date-only record (activity, calendar event, ticket, note, survey, health), whose date is the date part of `occurred_at` (midnight UTC), not a moment. `actor` is `{id, name}` with `id` a user id when the row links a user and `null` when only a name is stored, or `null` (activity, calendar event, survey, health). `link` is `{thread_id, url}`: `thread_id` is an email's thread (null when blank); `url` is a ticket's `external_url` or a call's `recording_url`, sent only when it starts with `http://` or `https://`, else null. `attention` (backend Task 7) is exactly `{renewal: {date, days, overdue} \| null, tickets: {count, oldest_days} \| null, overdue_tasks: {count, oldest_days} \| null, questions: {count} \| null, anomaly: {id, title, first_seen_at, last_seen_at} \| null}`, each null when nothing needs attention: renewal only when overdue or due within 30 days and never for a churned organization; tickets are open High or Critical; `anomaly.title` is always a string (withheld as "Similar reports across 1 of your companies" unless the viewer sees everything). |
| 11 | Filters: All · Conversations · Tickets · Tasks & notes · Feedback · Health & usage, a Sources picker (exact types) and search. "A source with no real data never appears." | The feed's 13 chips include placeholders (Pulse, Conversations, Revenact Support), a fake Slack filter and browser-only Sessions. | `STORY_GROUPS` and `STORY_KINDS` (Task 1) list only the nine real kinds. The Sources picker offers the chosen group's kinds that have data (`counts.by_kind[kind] > 0`, the backend's answer to "a source with no real data never appears in Sources"), plus any already chosen; choosing a group drops sources outside it. `group`, `source` and `q` live in the URL too, so a filtered story survives refresh and Back; search writes `q` 300ms after typing stops (or on Enter), with `replace`. Filters with a zero count still show. |
| 12 | "+ Add: Log activity, New task, New note, Log survey. These are the existing create flows." | Each flow is an inline form toggled inside its own tab (`TasksTab`, `NotesTab`, `SurveysTab`, `CallSenseTab`). `Activity` has no create endpoint (`CustomerActivityListView` is list-only; backend pre-flight 22). A call create endpoint does exist: `_CallListView` is a `ListCreateAPIView` behind `POST /customers/{id}/calls/` and `POST /customers/{id}/accounts/{account_id}/calls/`, which CallSense's "Log a call" uses. | Task 12 lifts each form out as an exported component (`TaskForm`, `NoteForm`, `CallForm`, `LogSurveyForm`), leaving the tabs' behaviour and labels unchanged. `AddFlow` (Task 13) shows the chosen one in a `Sheet`; the menu reads **Log a call · New task · New note · Log survey**. It creates on the organization, or on the chosen account when an account chip is active. On success the sheet closes, the story reloads and a polite status says "Added to the story." |
| 13 | "Opening an email shows its thread." | `EmailThreadPanel` invents a kickoff message for every logged email (`buildThread`), loads pravatar avatars, and its Reply, Forward, quick-reply and emoji controls do nothing. | The backend has no thread endpoint; it adds `thread=<thread_id>` to the story (backend pre-flight 14): that thread's emails only, across the organization and its accounts, under the same rules, newest first; it narrows `items`, not `counts` or `attention`. A new `EmailThread` (Task 11) reads `GET /organizations/{id}/story/?thread=<link.thread_id>&limit=100` (every page, through `fetchThread`) and shows the messages oldest first, each with its sender (`actor`), time and summary (the backend's one-line, 240-character `summary`; the full message stays in Communications). An email whose `link.thread_id` is null (logged in Revenact) has no thread and opens in place like any other item. No reply controls on this page; replying stays in Communications. `EmailThreadPanel` stays for `/accounts/:id`. |
| 14 | "Other items open their existing detail." | Tasks, notes, activities, calendar events and health changes have no detail page; a ticket has its `external_url`, a call its `recording_url`; surveys are edited on `/surveys`. | A non-email item's title toggles it open in place (the full summary) and, when the server sends `link.url`, an "Open in <source>" link (external, new tab, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, `http(s)://` only, as the backend already guarantees). The backend sends no in-app paths, so there are no in-app links. |
| 15 | Calls carry their CallSense summary. | CallSense is a feed sub-tab listing calls with recording, participants and transcript. | The story shows a call's summary (the backend's `summary`). The full CallSense list moves to the **Files** tab under a "Calls" heading, beside the files, as "current content". |
| 16 | Knowledge is today's Company View. | Headlines (an AI digest with Regenerate) and AI attributes are real and have no place in the six tabs. | Headlines go under Company View on the Knowledge tab. `AIAttributesPanel` goes under the six panels on the Details tab. |
| 17 | The next page loads at the end of the list. | `useEndSentinel` and `MoreButton` exist in `portfolio/`. | `StoryStream` (Task 10) reuses both: a 1px sentinel after the last day and a visible Show more as the fallback. The observer's root is the viewport (the frame is unchanged). |
| 18 | Details: the List's six panels, stacked on phones, with Edit details. | `AccountDetails` takes `stacked` and `onEdit`. | `DetailsTab` (Task 15) renders the Accounts section (pre-flight 8), then `AccountDetails stacked={!isSm}`, whose Edit details opens the same `OrganizationFormModal`. |
| 19 | Removals (§1.10). | The Slack tab, fake pinned Pulse, invented NPS counts, placeholders, "Enable new 360 UI", every dead control, Clearbit and pravatar, `PinnedAttributes`, the All-attributes modal and the Overview sub-tab all live in `Details.tsx` or in shared components the account page also renders (`ActivityFeed`, `PinnedAttributes`, `SlackTab`, `EmailThreadPanel`). | The rewrite drops everything from this page. Shared components `/accounts/:id` still imports stay (spec §6 plans that page). `HealthPopover` and `CsatPopover` have no importers left and are deleted after a grep (Task 18). The house-rules scan also forbids `clearbit` and `pravatar` in the new folder and the page. |
| 20 | Tests at three levels. | `Details.test.tsx` has 40 tests, most about the old page. Its Contacts, Pipelines and Surveys tests are the only coverage of `ContactsTab`, `PipelinesTab` and `SurveysTab`, which live on. | Task 12 moves the survey tests to `SurveysTab.test.tsx` and Task 15 moves the contacts and pipelines tests to `PeopleTab.test.tsx` and `DealsTab.test.tsx`, by line range from the untouched file, rendering those components directly. Task 16 replaces `Details.test.tsx` with the new page's integration tests. |
| 21 | The Surveys page's row-click lands on this page's Surveys filter. | `SurveysPage.tsx:86` navigates with `state.activityFilter: 'Surveys'`. | It navigates to `/organizations/{id}?group=feedback` (Task 16). `ActivityFeed`'s `initialFilter` stays for `/accounts/:id`. |
| 22 | Every new part meets the house rules. | `portfolio/houseRules.test.ts` scans its own folder only. | Task 3 lifts its scanners into `src/test/houseRules.ts` (`houseRuleSuite`), adds a no-third-party-image rule, and points a second suite at `detail/` (and, from Task 16, at `pages/organizations/Details.tsx`). |
| 23 | The account tag reads "Organisation" when an item has no account. | The app's UI copy says "organization". | The tag and the chip read **Organization**, matching the app's US spelling rule. |
| 24 | Items are grouped by day. | `occurred_at` is always a UTC timestamp; `all_day` marks a date-only record (cast to midnight UTC). | `dayKey(item)` reads a timed item in the viewer's time zone and an `all_day` item as the date part of `occurred_at` (so a note never slips to the day before west of UTC); an `all_day` item shows no time. Days read "Today", "Yesterday" or "31 Aug 2026". |
| 25 | The story's scope in time and kind. | Backend pre-flight 7, 9 and 10. | Future-dated records are excluded (nothing on or after tomorrow's midnight UTC), a task appears at its `created_at`, and Health & usage holds only health-category, AI-pulse and CSM-pulse changes between month-end snapshots. The page adds no rule of its own; the test stub mirrors all three. |

### Task 1: The story contract, its kinds and the test stub

**Files:**
- Create: `src/features/organizations/storyTypes.ts`
- Create: `src/features/organizations/storyKinds.ts`
- Create: `src/features/organizations/storyApi.ts`
- Create: `src/features/organizations/testStory.ts`

- Produces:
  - Types: `StoryGroup`, `StoryKind`, `StoryRef`, `StoryActor`, `StoryLink`, `StoryItem`, `StoryAttention`, `StoryCounts`, `StoryResponse` (exactly as below, mirroring the backend's `items.py`, `build.py` and its plan's Task 7).

### Task 2: The page's URL state and day grouping

**Files:**
- Create: `src/features/organizations/detailParams.ts`
- Create: `src/features/organizations/storyDays.ts`
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/useDetailParams.ts`
- Test: `src/features/organizations/detailParams.test.ts`, `src/features/organizations/storyDays.test.ts`, `src/components/organizations/detail/useDetailParams.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `isStoryGroup`, `isStoryKind`, `kindsIn` (Task 1); `StoryFilters` (Task 1); `formatDate` (`features/customers/formatters.ts`).
- Produces:
  - `type DetailTab = 'story' | 'details' | 'people' | 'deals' | 'knowledge' | 'files'`, `DETAIL_TABS: {key: DetailTab; label: string}[]`, `interface DetailParams {tab; account: string; group: StoryGroup | ''; sources: StoryKind[]; q: string}`, `parseDetailParams(search: URLSearchParams): DetailParams`, `toDetailSearch(p: DetailParams): URLSearchParams`, `withPatch(p: DetailParams, patch: Partial<DetailParams>): DetailParams`, `storyFilters(p: DetailParams): StoryFilters`, `hasStoryFilters(p: DetailParams): boolean`, `detailTabId(base: string, tab: DetailTab): string`, `detailPanelId(base: string): string`.
  - `type Timed = {occurred_at: string; all_day: boolean}`, `localDay(date: Date): string`, `dayKey(item: Timed): string`, `timeLabel(item: Timed): string`, `dayLabel(key: string, today: string): string`, `groupByDay<T extends Timed>(items: T[]): {key: string; items: T[]}[]`.
  - `useDetailParams(): {params: DetailParams; update: (patch: Partial<DetailParams>, options?: {replace?: boolean}) => void}` (`update` is stable).

### Task 3: One house-rules suite for both folders, and the `Sheet`

**Files:**
- Create: `src/test/houseRules.ts`
- Create: `src/test/houseRules.test.ts`
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/houseRules.test.ts` (whole file)
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/houseRules.test.ts`
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/Sheet.tsx`
- Test: `src/components/organizations/detail/Sheet.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `trapTab` (`src/lib/focusTrap.ts`), `FOCUS` (`portfolio/styles.ts`).
- Produces:
  - `RAW: RegExp`, `sizeOffenders(source: string): string[]`, `houseRuleSuite(title: string, files: Record<string, string>): void` (defines a `describe` block).
  - `Sheet({title: string; description?: string; isSm: boolean; onClose: () => void; children: ReactNode})`: a modal dialog, a right-hand panel from `sm` (`data-shape="panel"`) and a bottom sheet below it (`data-shape="sheet"`). Focus goes to its first field (or Close); Tab is trapped; body scroll is locked; Escape, Close or the scrim close it; focus returns to the opener.

- Produces:
  - `interface OrganizationState {row: PortfolioRow | null; customer: Customer | null; loading: boolean; notFound: boolean; error: string | null; customerError: string | null; retry: () => void}` and `useOrganization(id: number | null, version: number): OrganizationState`.
  - `interface StoryState {data: StoryResponse | null; items: StoryItem[]; next: string | null; loading: boolean; error: string | null; loadingMore: boolean; moreError: string | null; loadMore: () => Promise<void>; retry: () => void}` and `useStory(orgId: number, query: string, version: number, enabled: boolean): StoryState`.

### Task 5: The name row: `Menu` and `OrganizationHeader`

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/Menu.tsx`
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/OrganizationHeader.tsx`
- Test: `src/components/organizations/detail/Menu.test.tsx`, `src/components/organizations/detail/OrganizationHeader.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `useDismiss` (`portfolio/useDismiss.ts`), `FOCUS`, `BUTTON` (`portfolio/styles.ts`), `SignalTag`, `touchText` (`portfolio/rowParts.tsx`), `PORTFOLIO_FIELDS` (`portfolioFields.ts`).
- Produces:
  - `interface MenuItem {key: string; label: string; onSelect: () => void; danger?: boolean}` and `Menu({label: string; trigger: ReactNode; triggerClassName: string; items: MenuItem[]; align?: 'start' | 'end'})`.
  - `OrganizationHeader({row: PortfolioRow; canEdit: boolean; onEdit: () => void; onArchive: () => void; onChurn: () => void})`. It renders `data-field="organization"`, `"owner"` and `"lifecycleStage"` (header fields for the coverage test).

### Task 6: The four tiles and the health breakdown

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/HealthBreakdown.tsx`
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/HeaderTiles.tsx`
- Test: `src/components/organizations/detail/HeaderTiles.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `HealthRing`, `TrendLine`, `RenewalRunway`, `PulsePair`, `renewalText` (`rowParts.tsx`); `HEALTH_LABEL` (`portfolioLabels.ts`); `PanelKey` (`portfolioFields.ts`); `formatCompactMoney`, `formatDate`; `Customer`, `HealthComponent` (`customersSlice.ts`); `pizzaHutCustomer` (Task 1).
- Produces:
  - `HealthBreakdown({id: string; customer: Customer | null; error: string | null})`: `<section aria-label="Health breakdown">`.
  - `HeaderTiles({row: PortfolioRow; customer: Customer | null; customerError: string | null; isSm: boolean; onJump: (panel: PanelKey) => void})`. Health toggles the breakdown; ARR → `onJump('commercial')`, Renewal → `onJump('contract')`, Pulse → `onJump('voice')`. It renders `data-field="health"`, `"pulse"` and `"aiPulseScore"` (through `HealthRing` and `PulsePair`).

### Task 7: Account chips and the tablist

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/AccountChips.tsx`
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/DetailTabs.tsx`
- Test: `src/components/organizations/detail/AccountChips.test.tsx`, `src/components/organizations/detail/DetailTabs.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Account` (`customersSlice.ts`); `DETAIL_TABS`, `DetailTab`, `detailTabId`, `detailPanelId` (Task 2); `FOCUS`, `QUIET` (`styles.ts`); `ACCOUNTS` (Task 1).
- Produces:
  - `AccountChips({accounts: Account[]; loading: boolean; error: string | null; counts: Record<string, number> | null; selected: string; onSelect: (value: string) => void; onRetry: () => void; onAdd: () => void; onEdit: (account: Account) => void})`. Chips: All (`counts.all`), each account (`counts[id] ?? 0`), and Organization (`counts.none`) when it has items or is chosen. `counts` is the backend's `by_account`: `all`, `none` and every in-scope account id. Pressing the chosen account chip again returns to All (`onSelect('')`).
  - `DetailTabs({idBase: string; active: DetailTab; onChange: (tab: DetailTab) => void})`: `role="tablist"`, roving tab index, arrows/Home/End with automatic activation, the active tab scrolled into view.

### Task 8: Needs attention

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/AttentionBlock.tsx`
- Test: `src/components/organizations/detail/AttentionBlock.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `StoryAttention`, `StoryGroup` (Task 1), `DetailTab` (Task 2), `PanelKey`, `formatDate`, `FOCUS`; `PIZZA_ATTENTION`, `QUIET_ATTENTION` (Task 1).
- Produces: `AttentionBlock({attention: StoryAttention; onFilter: (group: StoryGroup) => void; onOpenTab: (tab: DetailTab) => void; onJump: (panel: PanelKey) => void})`. Reads the backend's keys (`renewal`, `tickets`, `overdue_tasks`, `questions`, `anomaly`; backend plan Task 7). Renders nothing when every part is null. Renewal (`overdue` sets the tone) → `onJump('contract')`; tickets → `onFilter('tickets')`; overdue tasks → `onFilter('tasks')`; questions → `onOpenTab('knowledge')`; the anomaly is text only: its `title` as sent (already withheld for a viewer who does not see everything) and its `last_seen_at` date.

### Task 9: The story toolbar: filters, Sources, search and + Add

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/SourcesPicker.tsx`
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/StoryToolbar.tsx`
- Test: `src/components/organizations/detail/StoryToolbar.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `STORY_GROUPS`, `STORY_KINDS`, `offeredSources`, `ADD_FLOWS`, `AddKind`, `StoryCounts` (Task 1); `Menu` (Task 5); `useDismiss`; `BUTTON`, `FOCUS`, `QUIET`.
- Produces:
  - `SourcesPicker({offered: StoryKind[]; selected: StoryKind[]; onChange: (next: StoryKind[]) => void})`: a button "Sources" (with "· n" when some are chosen) opening a checkbox panel and an "Every source" reset.
  - `StoryToolbar({group; sources; q; byGroup: StoryCounts['by_group'] | null; byKind: StoryCounts['by_kind'] | null; isSm: boolean; onGroup: (group: StoryGroup | '') => void; onSources: (sources: StoryKind[]) => void; onSearch: (q: string) => void; onAdd: (what: AddKind) => void})`. All's count is `byGroup.all`. Search calls `onSearch(trimmed)` 300ms after typing stops, or at once on Enter; the draft follows `q` when it changes from outside. The Add button's name is "Add to the story".

### Task 10: The stream: items grouped by day, paging, and its states

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/StoryItemRow.tsx`
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/StoryStream.tsx`
- Test: `src/components/organizations/detail/StoryStream.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `StoryItem`, `StoryKind` (Task 1), `KIND_NAME`, `sourceName` (Task 1), `timeLabel`, `dayLabel`, `groupByDay`, `localDay` (Task 2), `StoryState` (Task 4), `EmptyState`, `ErrorBlock`, `MoreButton` (`portfolio/PortfolioSections.tsx`), `useEndSentinel`, `FOCUS`, `QUIET`; `installIntersectionObserver` (`src/test/intersection.ts`).
- Produces:
  - `StoryItemRow({item: StoryItem; onOpenEmail: (item: StoryItem) => void})`: `<li data-story-item="<kind>:<id>">`. An email with a `link.thread_id` has a title button that calls `onOpenEmail`; any other item (an email with no thread included), when it has a summary or a `link.url`, has a title that toggles it open (`aria-expanded`), showing the full summary and an "Open in <source>" link to `link.url`.
  - `StoryStream({story: StoryState; filtered: boolean; today?: string; onClearFilters: () => void; onOpenEmail: (item: StoryItem) => void})`.

### Task 12: Lift the four create forms out of their tabs (and move the survey tests)

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/activity/TasksTab.tsx` (the `NewTaskForm` function)
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/activity/NotesTab.tsx` (the `NewNoteForm` function)
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/activity/CallSenseTab.tsx` (the `LogCallForm` function)
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/activity/SurveysTab.tsx` (imports, state, `handleLogSurvey`, the log form block; new `LogSurveyForm`)
- Create: `src/pages/organizations/testDetail.tsx`
- Create (moved tests): `src/components/organizations/activity/SurveysTab.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the slices' `createSurveyForCustomer`, `createSurveyForAccount`, `fetchSurveysForCustomer`; `useMembers`; `LogCallInput` (`callsSlice.ts`); `Contact`.
- Produces:
  - `TaskForm({onCreate: (task: NewTask) => Promise<boolean>; onDone?: () => void})` (exported from `TasksTab.tsx`).
  - `NoteForm({onCreate: (note: {title: string; body: string}) => Promise<boolean>; onDone?: () => void})` (exported from `NotesTab.tsx`).
  - `CallForm({onLog: (input: LogCallInput) => Promise<boolean>; saving: boolean; error: string | null; contacts: Contact[]; onDone?: () => void})` (exported from `CallSenseTab.tsx`).
  - `interface LogSurveyFormProps {customerId: number; accountId?: number; allowCes: boolean; onLogged: () => void | Promise<void>; onCancel: () => void}` and `LogSurveyForm(props)` (exported from `SurveysTab.tsx`).
  - Each form clears itself and calls `onDone`/`onLogged` after a successful save. Labels and buttons are unchanged ("Task title", "Save task", "Note title", "Save note", "Call title", "Log call", "Type", "Sent", "Log").
  - `makeDetailStore()` (`testDetail.tsx`): a store with the real `customers`, `auth` (Alice, admin, every capability), `notifications`, `knowledge`, `files` and `calls` slices.

`Details.test.tsx` stays untouched until Task 16: this task and Task 15 copy tests out of it by line number. Check that first:

- [ ] **Step 1: Check the source of the moved tests**

Run:
```bash
git diff --quiet HEAD -- src/pages/organizations/Details.test.tsx && echo unchanged
sed -n '15p;71p;363p;585p' src/pages/organizations/Details.test.tsx
```
Expected:
```
unchanged
const globex = {
};
  it('fetches this organization\'s own real surveys on the General tab, under the Surveys filter', async () => {
  });
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Create the test store helper**

`src/pages/organizations/testDetail.tsx`:
```tsx
// Test-only helpers for the organization page. Task 16 adds renderOrganizationPage.
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import authReducer from '../../features/auth/authSlice';

```

- [ ] **Step 3: Move the survey tests (they stay red until the form exists)**

Run:
```bash
OLD=src/pages/organizations/Details.test.tsx
NEW=src/components/organizations/activity/SurveysTab.test.tsx
{
  cat <<'EOF'

import { LogSurveyForm, SurveysTab } from './SurveysTab';

// These tests lived in the old organization page's test, under its Surveys

// SurveysTab still serves the account page's feed, so they render it
// directly, fed the way ActivityFeed feeds it.
function SurveysHarness() {

      error={entitySurveysError}
      entityType="organization"
      entityId={10}
    />
  );
}

function renderSurveys() {
  render(
    <Provider store={makeDetailStore()}>
      <MemoryRouter>
        <SurveysHarness />
      </MemoryRouter>
    </Provider>,
  );
}

EOF
  sed -n '12,71p' "$OLD"
  cat <<'EOF'

describe('SurveysTab on an organization (moved from the old organization page)', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.unstubAllGlobals();
  });

EOF
  sed -n '363,585p' "$OLD"
  cat <<'EOF'
});

describe('LogSurveyForm (the "Log survey" flow the organization page reuses)', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.unstubAllGlobals();
  });

  it('logs on an account, without CES, and hands back', async () => {
    const fetchMock = vi.fn((_url: string, options?: { method?: string; body?: string }) =>
      Promise.resolve({ ok: true, status: 201, json: async () => ({ id: 1, ...JSON.parse(options?.body ?? '{}') }) }),
    );
    vi.stubGlobal('fetch', fetchMock);
    const onLogged = vi.fn();
    render(
      <Provider store={makeDetailStore()}>
        <LogSurveyForm customerId={7} accountId={31} allowCes={false} onLogged={onLogged} onCancel={() => {}} />
      </Provider>,
    );
    expect(screen.queryByRole('option', { name: 'CES' })).not.toBeInTheDocument();
    await userEvent.selectOptions(screen.getByLabelText('Type'), 'csat');
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Log' }));
    await waitFor(() => expect(onLogged).toHaveBeenCalledOnce());

grep -c "renderDetails\|name: 'Surveys' }" "$NEW"
```
Expected: the last command prints `0`.

In `SurveysTab.test.tsx`, the first moved test no longer uses its `user`. Replace:
```tsx
    renderSurveys();
    const user = userEvent.setup();

    // 'NPS' alone is ambiguous
```
with:
```tsx
    renderSurveys();

    // 'NPS' alone is ambiguous
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `npx vitest run src/components/organizations/activity/SurveysTab.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL: "LogSurveyForm" is not exported (`does not provide an export named 'LogSurveyForm'`).

- [ ] **Step 5: Lift the forms out**

In `src/components/organizations/activity/TasksTab.tsx`, replace the whole `function NewTaskForm(…) { … }` (from `function NewTaskForm({ onCreate }` to the `}` before `export function TasksTab`) with:
```tsx

In `src/components/organizations/activity/NotesTab.tsx`, replace the whole `function NewNoteForm(…) { … }` (up to the `}` before `export function NotesTab`) with:

In `src/components/organizations/activity/SurveysTab.tsx`:

1. Replace `import { useState } from 'react';` with `import { useId, useState } from 'react';`.
2. Delete these four lines from `SurveysTab`'s state:
```tsx
  const [newType, setNewType] = useState<Survey['survey_type']>('nps');
  const [newSentAt, setNewSentAt] = useState(() => new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10));
  const [isLogging, setIsLogging] = useState(false);
  const [logError, setLogError] = useState<string | null>(null);
```
3. Delete the whole `async function handleLogSurvey() { … }` (from `async function handleLogSurvey() {` to its closing `}` after the `finally` block).
4. Replace the log form block (from `{showLogForm && (` through `{logError && <p className="text-[12.5px] text-danger">{logError}</p>}`) with:
```tsx
      {showLogForm && canLog && (
        <LogSurveyForm
          customerId={entityType === 'organization' ? Number(entityId) : (customerId as number)}
          accountId={entityType === 'account' ? Number(entityId) : undefined}
          allowCes={entityType === 'organization'}
          onLogged={async () => {
            await refetch();
            setShowLogForm(false);
          }}
          onCancel={() => setShowLogForm(false)}
        />
      )}
```
5. Add, directly above `export function SurveysTab(`:
```tsx
export interface LogSurveyFormProps {
  customerId: number;
  /** Set to log it on one of the organization's accounts. */
  accountId?: number;
  /** CES is asked of an organization only. */
  allowCes: boolean;

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tab tests to verify they pass and nothing else moved**

Run: `npx vitest run src/components/organizations/activity src/pages/organizations/Details.test.tsx src/pages/accounts/Details.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS. The moved survey tests and the two `LogSurveyForm` tests pass; `TasksTab.test`, `NotesTab.test` and `CallSenseTab.test` pass unchanged; the old `Details.test.tsx` still passes (its page still renders these tabs).

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add src/components/organizations/activity/TasksTab.tsx src/components/organizations/activity/NotesTab.tsx src/components/organizations/activity/CallSenseTab.tsx src/components/organizations/activity/SurveysTab.tsx src/components/organizations/activity/SurveysTab.test.tsx src/pages/organizations/testDetail.tsx
git commit -m "refactor(organizations): lift the task, note, call and survey forms out of their tabs

### Task 13: "+ Add" in a sheet: `AddFlow`

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/AddFlow.tsx`
- Test: `src/components/organizations/detail/AddFlow.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `TaskForm`, `NoteForm`, `CallForm`, `LogSurveyForm` (Task 12); `createTask`, `createNote` (`customersSlice.ts`); `logCall` (`callsSlice.ts`); `FileParent`; `Sheet` (Task 3); `ADD_FLOWS`, `AddKind` (Task 1); `makeDetailStore` (Task 12); `stubOrganizationPage`, `postBodies` (Task 1).
- Produces: `AddFlow({what: AddKind; customerId: number; accountId?: number; accountName?: string; isSm: boolean; onAdded: () => void; onClose: () => void})`: a `Sheet` titled with the flow's label ("New task") and described "On EMEA" or "On the organization".

### Task 14: The Story tab

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/organizations/detail/StoryTab.tsx`
- Test: `src/components/organizations/detail/StoryTab.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `AttentionBlock` (Task 8), `StoryToolbar` (Task 9), `StoryStream` (Task 10), `EmailThread` (Task 11), `AddFlow` (Task 13), `StoryState` (Task 4), `DetailParams`, `DetailTab`, `hasStoryFilters`, `parseDetailParams` (Task 2), `Account`, `PanelKey`.
- Produces: `StoryTab({orgId: number; story: StoryState; params: DetailParams; accounts: Account[]; isSm: boolean; onUpdate: (patch: Partial<DetailParams>, options?: {replace?: boolean}) => void; onAdded: () => void; onOpenTab: (tab: DetailTab) => void; onJump: (panel: PanelKey) => void})`. Search writes `q` with `replace`; Clear filters clears `account`, `group`, `sources` and `q`; a save closes the sheet, calls `onAdded` and says "Added to the story." politely.

- Create (moved tests): `src/components/organizations/detail/PeopleTab.test.tsx`, `src/components/organizations/detail/DealsTab.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Account` (`customersSlice.ts`), `AI_PULSE_LABELS` (`formatters.ts`), `pulseWords` (`portfolioFields.ts`), `QUIET`, `FOCUS`, `ACCOUNTS` (Task 1); `AccountDetails` (`portfolio/AccountDetails.tsx`, `stacked`, `onEdit`); `AIAttributesPanel`, `ContactsTab`, `PipelinesTab` (`components/shared`); `CompanyViewTab`; `HeadlinesTab`, `FilesTab`, `CallSenseTab` (`components/organizations/activity`); thunks `fetchContactsForCustomer`, `fetchOpportunitiesForCustomer`, `fetchRisksForCustomer`, `fetchHeadlinesForCustomer`, `regenerateHeadlines`; `OrganizationHeader` (Task 5), `HeaderTiles` (Task 6); `makeDetailStore` (Task 12).
- Produces:
  - `interface AccountsSectionProps {items: Account[]; loading: boolean; error: string | null; onRetry: () => void; onAdd: () => void; onEdit: (account: Account) => void}` and `AccountsSection(props)`: the owner's Accounts section (2026-09-26): a heading with Add account, then one list item per connected account (not a table) with its name linking to `/accounts/:id`, owner, domain, "AI n" with the AI label, the pulse dots, the AI reason, and Edit; designed loading, error and empty states.
  - `DetailsTab({row: PortfolioRow; customerId: number; isSm: boolean; accounts: AccountsSectionProps; onEdit?: () => void})`: the Accounts section, then the six panels (`stacked` below `sm`) with Edit details, then AI attributes.
  - `PeopleTab({customerId: number})`, `DealsTab({customerId: number})`, `KnowledgeTab({customerId: number; customerName: string})`, `FilesCallsTab({customerId: number})`: today's content, each reading its data when first opened.

- [ ] **Step 1: Check the source of the moved tests**

Run:
```bash
git diff --quiet HEAD -- src/pages/organizations/Details.test.tsx && echo unchanged
sed -n '629p;886p;888p;955p;1002p;1285p' src/pages/organizations/Details.test.tsx
```
Expected:
```
unchanged
  it('fetches and renders this organization\'s own real contacts on the Contacts tab', async () => {
  });
  it('fetches and renders this organization\'s own real opportunities and risks on the Pipelines tab', async () => {
  });
  describe('Pipelines tab search/Add/Edit/Delete', () => {
  });
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Move the contacts and pipelines tests (red until the tabs exist)**

Run:
```bash
OLD=src/pages/organizations/Details.test.tsx
DIR=src/components/organizations/detail
{
  cat <<'EOF'
import { beforeEach, describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';

import { makeDetailStore } from '../../../pages/organizations/testDetail';
import { PeopleTab } from './PeopleTab';

// These tests lived in the old organization page's test, under its Contacts
// tab. People keeps that content in delivery 1 (spec §4), so they render
// PeopleTab directly; it reads the contacts itself when opened.
function renderPeople() {
  render(
    <Provider store={makeDetailStore()}>

function renderDeals() {
  render(
    <Provider store={makeDetailStore()}>
      <MemoryRouter>
        <DealsTab customerId={10} />
      </MemoryRouter>
    </Provider>,

grep -c "renderDetails\|name: /^Contacts/\|name: /^Pipelines/" "$DIR/PeopleTab.test.tsx" "$DIR/DealsTab.test.tsx"
```
Expected: the last command prints `…PeopleTab.test.tsx:0` and `…DealsTab.test.tsx:0`.

In `PeopleTab.test.tsx`, the first moved test no longer uses its `user`. Replace:
```tsx
    renderPeople();
    const user = userEvent.setup();

    expect(await screen.findByText('Sarah Chen')).toBeInTheDocument();
```
with:
```tsx
    renderPeople();

    expect(await screen.findByText('Sarah Chen')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the new failing tests**

The Accounts section reads only what `GET /customers/{id}/accounts/` serves (`AccountSerializer` in revenact-backend `services/customers/serializers.py`): `name`, `owner` (nested user), `domain`, `pulse` (the stored dots), `ai_pulse_score` (the category), `ai_pulse_value` (the number) and `ai_pulse_reason`. All seven exist, so nothing is dropped. The frontend `Account` type lacks `ai_pulse_value`; add it in `src/features/customers/customersSlice.ts`, directly under `ai_pulse_reason: string;`:
```ts
  /** The AI pulse as a number (1-5), null when unscored; AccountSerializer's `ai_pulse_value`. Optional because older fixtures omit it. */
  ai_pulse_value?: number | null;

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `npx vitest run src/components/organizations/detail src/pages/organizations/Details.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS: the six Accounts section tests, the four new tab tests, the 37 field-coverage cases, every moved contacts and pipelines test, the whole `detail/` folder (house rules included), and the old `Details.test.tsx` (still untouched).

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add src/features/customers/customersSlice.ts src/components/organizations/detail/AccountsSection.tsx src/components/organizations/detail/AccountsSection.test.tsx src/components/organizations/detail/DetailsTab.tsx src/components/organizations/detail/PeopleTab.tsx src/components/organizations/detail/DealsTab.tsx src/components/organizations/detail/KnowledgeTab.tsx src/components/organizations/detail/FilesCallsTab.tsx src/components/organizations/detail/otherTabs.test.tsx src/components/organizations/detail/fieldCoverage.test.tsx src/components/organizations/detail/PeopleTab.test.tsx src/components/organizations/detail/DealsTab.test.tsx

### Task 16: The page: rewrite `Details.tsx` (integration tests, phones included)

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/pages/organizations/Details.tsx` (rewrite, whole file)
- Modify: `src/pages/organizations/Details.test.tsx` (rewrite, whole file)
- Modify: `src/pages/organizations/testDetail.tsx` (add `renderOrganizationPage`)
- Modify: `src/pages/organizations/OrganizationsFrame.tsx` (doc comment's first line)
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/detail/houseRules.test.ts` (scan the page too)
- Modify: `src/pages/surveys/SurveysPage.tsx` (`handleRowClick`), `src/pages/surveys/SurveysPage.test.tsx` (`DetailsStub`, one expectation)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything from Tasks 1-15; `OrganizationsFrame`; `OrganizationFormModal`, `ChurnOrganizationModal`, `ConfirmDialog`, `AccountFormModal`; `bulkUpdate`; `fetchAccountsForCustomer`; `EmptyState`, `ErrorBlock`, `errorMessage`, `FOCUS`, `QUIET`; `SM`, `useMediaQuery`.
- Produces:
  - `Details()` (the same export `App.tsx` routes to `/organizations/:id`).
  - `renderOrganizationPage(url?: string, options?: {width?: number; nav?: boolean; list?: boolean}): {store}` (`testDetail.tsx`): the real store and router with the page at `/organizations/:id` and, at `/organizations/list`, the real `List` when `list` is set (a marker otherwise), each with a `data-testid="where"` line; `nav` adds the real `Navbar`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the page render helper**

In `src/pages/organizations/testDetail.tsx`, replace the first line (`// Test-only helpers for the organization page. Task 16 adds renderOrganizationPage.`) and the imports below it with:
```tsx
// Test-only helpers for the organization page: its store and its render.
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { MemoryRouter, Route, Routes, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Navbar } from '../../components/layout/Navbar';
import authReducer from '../../features/auth/authSlice';
import callsReducer from '../../features/calls/callsSlice';
import customersReducer from '../../features/customers/customersSlice';
import filesReducer from '../../features/files/filesSlice';
import knowledgeReducer from '../../features/knowledge/knowledgeSlice';
import notificationsReducer from '../../features/notifications/notificationsSlice';
import { ALL_CAPABILITIES } from '../../test/capabilities';
import { setViewport } from '../../test/viewport';
import { Details } from './Details';
import { List } from './List';
```
and append to the end of the file:
```tsx
function Where() {
  const location = useLocation();
  return <p data-testid="where">{`${location.pathname}${location.search}`}</p>;
}

/** The organization page on the real store and router. `list` puts the real
 *  List at /organizations/list (a marker otherwise); `nav` adds the real
 *  Navbar. Only fetch is stubbed, by the caller (stubOrganizationPage). */
export function renderOrganizationPage(
  url = '/organizations/7',
  { width = 1440, nav = false, list = false }: { width?: number; nav?: boolean; list?: boolean } = {},
) {
  setViewport(width);
  const store = makeDetailStore();
  render(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <MemoryRouter initialEntries={[url]}>
        {nav ? <Navbar /> : null}
        <Routes>
          <Route
            path="/organizations/:id"
            element={
              <>
                <Details />
                <Where />
              </>
            }
          />
          <Route
            path="/organizations/list"
            element={
              <>
                {list ? <List /> : <p>Organizations list</p>}
                <Where />
              </>
            }
          />
        </Routes>
      </MemoryRouter>
    </Provider>,
  );
  return { store };
}

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `npx vitest run src/pages/organizations/Details.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL. The old page renders "General", no `data-part="header"`, and none of the new tabs, so "Unable to find role="heading" … name "Pizza Hut"" and similar.

- [ ] **Step 5: Point the house rules at the page, name the frame's third user, and land the Surveys page's row-click on Feedback**

Replace the whole of `src/components/organizations/detail/houseRules.test.ts` with:
```ts
import { houseRuleSuite } from '../../../test/houseRules';

// Spec 2026-09-26 §1 and the design skill's §4 over every part of the
// organization page, and the page itself.
houseRuleSuite('organization page house rules', {
  ...(import.meta.glob('./**/*.tsx', { query: '?raw', eager: true, import: 'default' }) as Record<string, string>),
  ...(import.meta.glob('../../../pages/organizations/Details.tsx', { query: '?raw', eager: true, import: 'default' }) as Record<
    string,
    string
  >),
});
```

In `src/pages/organizations/OrganizationsFrame.tsx`, replace:
```tsx
/** The Organizations list's and board's frame: DashboardFrame's body, class for class
```
with:
```tsx
/** The Organizations frame (the list, the board and an organization's page): DashboardFrame's body, class for class
```

In `src/pages/surveys/SurveysPage.tsx`, replace:
```tsx
    navigate(`/organizations/${customerId}`, { state: { activityFilter: 'Surveys' } });
```
with:
```tsx
    // The organization page's Story, filtered to Feedback (surveys).
    navigate(`/organizations/${customerId}?group=feedback`);
```

In `src/pages/surveys/SurveysPage.test.tsx`, replace:
```tsx
function DetailsStub() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  const location = useLocation();
  const state = location.state as { activityFilter?: string } | null;
  return (
    <div>
      Organization {id} — filter: {state?.activityFilter ?? 'none'}
    </div>
  );
}
```
with:
```tsx
function DetailsStub() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  const location = useLocation();
  return (
    <div>
      Organization {id} — {location.search || 'no filter'}
    </div>
  );
}
```
and replace:
```tsx
    expect(await screen.findByText('Organization 6 — filter: Surveys')).toBeInTheDocument();
```
with:
```tsx
    expect(await screen.findByText('Organization 6 — ?group=feedback')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `npx vitest run src/pages/organizations src/components/organizations src/pages/surveys src/features/organizations`
Expected: PASS: the new page tests (18), the house rules over `detail/` and `Details.tsx`, the Surveys page test, and every organizations test besides.

- [ ] **Step 7: Type-check, lint and commit**

Run: `npx tsc -b --noEmit && npx eslint src/pages/organizations src/components/organizations/detail src/components/organizations/activity src/features/organizations src/pages/surveys src/test`
Expected: no output from tsc; eslint reports 0 errors and no warnings in these paths.

```bash
git add src/pages/organizations/Details.tsx src/pages/organizations/Details.test.tsx src/pages/organizations/testDetail.tsx src/pages/organizations/OrganizationsFrame.tsx src/components/organizations/detail/houseRules.test.ts src/pages/surveys/SurveysPage.tsx src/pages/surveys/SurveysPage.test.tsx

### Task 17: Chrome: the transparent top bar and `p-0` on `/organizations/:id`

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` (imports; the organization-detail block near lines 76-87; `isOrgView`/`isFramed`; the `organization` header branch near lines 270-288)
- Modify: `src/components/layout/Navbar.test.tsx` (the `Navbar organization breadcrumb (/organizations/:id)` describe block)
- Modify: `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx` (`isOrgView`), `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.test.tsx` (the `p-0` list)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing new.
- Produces: on `/^\/organizations\/\d+$/` the Navbar is the framed transparent bar (`h-16 shrink-0 flex items-center gap-3 px-4`) with a "‹ Organizations" link to `/organizations/list` inside `nav[aria-label="Breadcrumb"]`, the empty actions slot, the bell, and no avatar; it reads nothing from `state.customers.selectedCustomer`. `DashboardLayout` gives that route `p-0`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

In `src/components/layout/Navbar.test.tsx`, replace the whole `describe('Navbar organization breadcrumb (/organizations/:id)', () => { … });` block with:
```tsx
describe('Navbar on an organization page (/organizations/:id)', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.unstubAllGlobals();
  });

  it('wears the Organizations frame: transparent bar, a way back to the list, the actions slot, no avatar', () => {
    const setSlot = vi.fn();
    renderNavbar('/organizations/10', globex, null, [], setSlot);
    const header = document.querySelector('header');
    expect(header).toHaveClass('h-16', 'shrink-0', 'flex', 'items-center', 'gap-3', 'px-4');
    for (const cls of ['bg-surface', 'border-b', 'shadow-sm']) expect(header).not.toHaveClass(cls);
    const back = within(screen.getByRole('navigation', { name: 'Breadcrumb' })).getByRole('link', { name: 'Organizations' });
    expect(back).toHaveAttribute('href', '/organizations/list');
    expect(setSlot).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.any(HTMLElement));
    expect(header!.querySelector('[data-nav-actions-slot]')).not.toBeNull();
    expect(screen.queryByAltText('Alice Admin')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('leaves the name to the page (no uppercase heading, no third-party logo)', () => {
    renderNavbar('/organizations/10', globex);
    expect(screen.queryByRole('heading', { name: 'Globex Corp' })).not.toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(document.querySelector('header img')).toBeNull();
  });

  it('takes you back to the list', async () => {
    renderNavbar('/organizations/10', globex);
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Organizations' }));
    expect(await screen.findByText('Organizations Marker')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

In `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.test.tsx`, replace:
```tsx
  it.each(['/dashboard/overview', '/communications', '/organizations/list', '/organizations/board'])('adds no padding around %s', (url) => {
```
with:
```tsx
  it.each(['/dashboard/overview', '/communications', '/organizations/list', '/organizations/board', '/organizations/7'])('adds no padding around %s', (url) => {
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `npx vitest run src/components/layout/Navbar.test.tsx src/layouts/DashboardLayout.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL: the header still has `border-b`, no Breadcrumb navigation exists, and `/organizations/7` is padded.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`:

1. Replace `import { NavLink, useLocation, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';` with `import { Link, NavLink, useLocation, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';`, and delete the line `import { mapCustomerToOrgRow } from '../../features/customers/mapToOrgRow';`.
2. Delete the block that starts `  // Detect organization details path. Reads the same selectedCustomer that` and ends with `    orgId && selectedCustomer?.id === orgId ? mapCustomerToOrgRow(selectedCustomer) : null;` (the comment, `orgDetailMatch`, `orgId`, `selectedCustomer` and `organization`).
3. Replace:
```tsx
  const isOrgView = location.pathname === '/organizations/list' || location.pathname === '/organizations/board';
  const isFramed = isDashboard || isOrgView;
```
with:
```tsx
  const isOrgView = location.pathname === '/organizations/list' || location.pathname === '/organizations/board';
  // An organization's page wears the same frame (organization page spec
  // §1.1): the page draws its own name row, so the bar only leads back.
  const isOrgDetail = /^\/organizations\/\d+$/.test(location.pathname);
  const isFramed = isDashboard || isOrgView || isOrgDetail;
```
4. Delete the header branch that starts `        ) : organization ? (` and ends on the line before `        ) : isOrgView ? (` (the back chevron, the Clearbit `EntityAvatar` and the uppercase `<h1>`), and put in its place:
```tsx
        ) : isOrgDetail ? (
          <nav aria-label="Breadcrumb" className="flex items-center h-full">
            <Link
              to="/organizations/list"
              className="-ml-2 inline-flex min-h-11 sm:min-h-9 items-center gap-1 rounded-lg px-2 text-[13px] font-semibold text-ink-muted hover:bg-subtle hover:text-ink focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-accent"
            >
              <ChevronLeft className="w-4 h-4" aria-hidden="true" />
              Organizations
            </Link>
          </nav>
```

In `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx`, replace:
```tsx
  const isOrgView = location.pathname === '/organizations/list' || location.pathname === '/organizations/board';
```
with:
```tsx
  // The Organizations frame: the list, the board and an organization's page.
  const isOrgView =
    location.pathname === '/organizations/list' ||
    location.pathname === '/organizations/board' ||
    /^\/organizations\/\d+$/.test(location.pathname);
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `npx vitest run src/components/layout src/layouts`
Expected: PASS (the three new Navbar tests, the widened layout test, and every other Navbar and layout test).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx src/components/layout/Navbar.test.tsx src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx src/layouts/DashboardLayout.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(organizations): the organization page wears the Organizations frame

### Task 18: Removals: prove what is gone, delete what nothing imports

**Files:**
- Delete: `src/components/organizations/HealthPopover.tsx`, `src/components/organizations/HealthPopover.test.tsx`, `src/components/organizations/CsatPopover.tsx`, `src/components/organizations/CsatPopover.test.tsx`
- Modify: `src/components/contacts/ContactRowActionsPopover.tsx` (one comment)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces: nothing new; `HealthBreakdown` (Task 6) is the page's health breakdown.

- [ ] **Step 1: Prove every §1.10 removal is off the page**

Run:
```bash
grep -rnE "ActivityFeed|PinnedAttributes|SlackTab|SessionsTab|EmailThreadPanel|MetricsBanner|AccountsMetricsBanner|clearbit|pravatar|Enable new 360 UI|Coming Soon|coming soon|Ask Copilot|Success Plans|CustomObjectsTab|CanvasListTab|account_pulse|Promoters" src/pages/organizations/Details.tsx src/components/organizations/detail --include='*.tsx' --include='*.ts' | grep -v '\.test\.' || echo "gone from the organization page"
```
Expected: `gone from the organization page`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Show which shared parts other pages still use (so they stay)**

Run:
```bash
for name in ActivityFeed PinnedAttributes SlackTab EmailThreadPanel CustomObjectsTab CanvasListTab accountActivityData EntityAvatar mapCustomerToOrgRow mapAccountToAccountRow; do
  printf '%s: ' "$name"; grep -rl "$name" src --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' | grep -v '\.test\.' | grep -vE "/$name\.tsx?$" | tr '\n' ' '; echo
done
```
Expected: each name lists at least one importer outside its own file (`pages/accounts/Details.tsx`, `components/shared/index.ts`, `pages/health/HealthDistribution.tsx`, `pages/lifecycle/LifecyclePage.tsx`, `pages/accounts/Board.tsx` and so on). Nothing here is deleted.

- [ ] **Step 3: Delete the two popovers nothing imports**

Run:
```bash
grep -rn "HealthPopover\|CsatPopover" src --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx'
```
Expected: hits only in `components/organizations/HealthPopover.tsx`, `HealthPopover.test.tsx`, `CsatPopover.tsx`, `CsatPopover.test.tsx`, and the comment in `components/contacts/ContactRowActionsPopover.tsx`.

In `src/components/contacts/ContactRowActionsPopover.tsx`, replace:
```tsx
// Same shape/positioning convention as the org popovers (HealthPopover)
// — a per-row "..." menu — just a shorter Edit/Delete list (Contact has
// no Archive/Churn-equivalent state to manage).
```
with:
```tsx
// A per-row "..." menu with a short Edit/Delete list (Contact has no
// Archive/Churn-equivalent state to manage).
```

Then:
```bash
git rm src/components/organizations/HealthPopover.tsx src/components/organizations/HealthPopover.test.tsx src/components/organizations/CsatPopover.tsx src/components/organizations/CsatPopover.test.tsx
grep -rn "HealthPopover\|CsatPopover" src --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' || echo "no importers left"
```
Expected: `no importers left`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the gates that could notice**

Run: `npx tsc -b --noEmit && npx vitest run src/components/organizations src/components/contacts`
Expected: no tsc output; tests PASS.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add src/components/contacts/ContactRowActionsPopover.tsx
git commit -m "chore(organizations): delete the unused health and CSAT popovers

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"

### Task 19: End-to-end (jsdom): open, filter by account, open an email, add a task, see it

**Files:**
- Create: `src/e2e/organizationDetail.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `renderOrganizationPage(url, {nav, list})` (Task 16), `stubOrganizationPage` (its default thread t-1), `postBodies` (Task 1), `resetViewport`.
- Produces: nothing.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the test**

`src/e2e/organizationDetail.test.tsx`:
```tsx
import { afterEach, beforeEach, describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { fireEvent, screen, waitFor, within } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { postBodies, stubOrganizationPage } from '../features/organizations/testStory';
import { renderOrganizationPage } from '../pages/organizations/testDetail';
import { resetViewport } from '../test/viewport';

// End-to-end tier (jsdom, no browser): the real Navbar, the List, the
// organization page, the store and the router. Only fetch is stubbed, with
// §2-shaped bodies; "+ Add" writes into the stub's story.
const where = () => new URL(`http://x${screen.getByTestId('where').textContent}`);
const itemKeys = () => [...document.querySelectorAll('[data-story-item]')].map((el) => el.getAttribute('data-story-item'));

describe('the organization page, end to end (spec §5)', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    Element.prototype.scrollIntoView = vi.fn();
  });
  afterEach(() => {
    vi.unstubAllGlobals();
    resetViewport();
    document.body.style.overflow = '';
    delete (Element.prototype as { scrollIntoView?: unknown }).scrollIntoView;
  });

  it('opens an organization, filters by an account, opens an email, adds a task and sees it in the story', { timeout: 30000 }, async () => {
    const spy = stubOrganizationPage();
    renderOrganizationPage('/organizations/list', { nav: true, list: true });

    // 1. Open Pizza Hut from the List; the page wears the Organizations frame.
    await userEvent.click(await screen.findByRole('link', { name: 'Pizza Hut' }));
    expect(where().pathname).toBe('/organizations/7');
    expect(await screen.findByRole('heading', { level: 1, name: 'Pizza Hut' })).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(within(screen.getByRole('navigation', { name: 'Breadcrumb' })).getByRole('link', { name: 'Organizations' })).toHaveAttribute(
      'href',
      '/organizations/list',
    );
    expect(document.querySelector('header')).not.toHaveClass('border-b');

    // 2. Filter the story by EMEA.
    await userEvent.click(await screen.findByRole('button', { name: 'EMEA 1' }));
    expect(where().searchParams.get('account')).toBe('31');
    await waitFor(() => expect(itemKeys()).toEqual(['email:41']));

    // 3. Open the email: its real thread (the message on the organization
    // itself included, though EMEA is chosen), then back to where we were.
    const email = screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Re: Renewal pricing' });
    await userEvent.click(email);
    const thread = screen.getByRole('dialog', { name: 'Re: Renewal pricing' });
    expect(await within(thread).findByText('Can we see the quote before the board meets on Friday?')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(within(thread).getByText('Sharing the renewal quote ahead of your board meeting.')).toBeInTheDocument();
    await userEvent.keyboard('{Escape}');
    expect(screen.queryByRole('dialog')).not.toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(email).toHaveFocus();

    // 4. Add a task; the chosen account is where it goes.
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Add to the story' }));
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('menuitem', { name: 'New task' }));
    const sheet = screen.getByRole('dialog', { name: 'New task' });
    expect(sheet).toHaveAccessibleDescription('On EMEA');
    await userEvent.type(within(sheet).getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Task title' }), 'Send the EMEA quote');
    fireEvent.change(within(sheet).getByLabelText('Due date'), { target: { value: '2026-10-01' } });
    await userEvent.click(within(sheet).getByRole('button', { name: 'Save task' }));

    // 5. It is in the story, filed under EMEA, and the chip counts it.
    await waitFor(() => expect(screen.queryByRole('dialog')).not.toBeInTheDocument());
    expect(postBodies(spy, '/customers/7/accounts/31/tasks/')).toHaveLength(1);
    const added = await screen.findByRole('button', { name: 'Send the EMEA quote' });
    expect(added.closest('[data-story-item]')).toHaveTextContent('EMEA');
    expect(await screen.findByRole('button', { name: 'EMEA 2' })).toHaveAttribute('aria-pressed', 'true');

    // 6. Back to All: the whole story, the new task included.
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'All 6' }));
    expect(where().searchParams.has('account')).toBe(false);
    await waitFor(() => expect(itemKeys()).toHaveLength(6));

    // 7. Back to the List through the top bar.
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByRole('link', { name: 'Organizations' }));
    expect(where().pathname).toBe('/organizations/list');
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it**

Run: `npx vitest run src/e2e/organizationDetail.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS (1 test). If a step fails, fix the owning task's code (with its own commit), not the test.

- [ ] **Step 3: Commit**

```bash
git add src/e2e/organizationDetail.test.tsx
git commit -m "test(organizations): end to end, from the list through the organization's story

### Task 20: Docs: `04-app-flow`, `03-ui-ux-design`, repo architecture

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/04-app-flow.md` (§ Organizations steps 4-6, §4.4, the placeholders table)
- Modify: `docs/03-ui-ux-design.md` (§6 Overlays and Composite, a new "Organization page" subsection, §10 Responsive, §12 debt row 11)
- Modify: `.agents/workflows/repo-architecture.md` (route tree, Details View section, dependency tree)

**Interfaces:** none (docs only). Product documents are updated in the same PR as the change (the memory's "Product documents" rule): the frontend holds two of the six, `03` and `04`.

- [ ] **Step 1: `docs/04-app-flow.md`**

Replace:
```markdown
4. On a row, the organisation name links to `/organizations/:id`; a row click
   or the chevron opens the row instead (inline on desktop, a sheet on
   phones). `/organizations/:id` dispatches six parallel fetches:
   the customer, its accounts, contacts, opportunities, risks and canvases.
5. Tabs: General (metrics banner, `PinnedAttributes`, `ActivityFeed`), Company
   View, Accounts, Contacts, Pipelines, Custom Objects, Success Plans.
   Under the pinned attributes, `AIAttributesPanel` lists the AI attributes
   defined in Settings > AI Attributes with the Copilot's latest answer, a
   "why" with reasoning and cited sources, the history of answers and
   corrections, an inline override and a refresh (see the backend's
   `attributes` contract)
   (placeholder), Canvas List.
6. "Ask Copilot" navigates to `/copilot?forCustomerId=&forCustomerName=`.
```
with:
```markdown
4. On a row, the organisation name links to `/organizations/:id`; a row click
   or the chevron opens the row instead (inline on desktop, a sheet on
   phones).
5. `/organizations/:id` is the organization's story
   (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-organization-detail-design.md`). It lands
   in four requests: `GET /organizations/portfolio/?ids={id}&include_churned=1`
   (the List's own row: the name row and the tiles), `GET /customers/{id}/`
   (the health breakdown and the edit form), `GET /customers/{id}/accounts/`
   (the account chips) and `GET /organizations/{id}/story/` (the Story). The
   tabs, in the URL as `?tab=`, are Story, Details (the connected accounts as
   list items linking to `/accounts/:id`, with Add and Edit; then the List's six
   panels, then `AIAttributesPanel`), People (contacts), Deals & risks (opportunities and
   risks), Knowledge (Company View, then headlines) and Files (files, then
   CallSense calls); the last four read their data when first opened. The
   account chips (`?account=`, an id or `none`) filter the Story, whose filters
   (`group`, `source`, `q`) live in the URL too. "+ Add" logs a call or a
   survey, or creates a task or a note, with the existing forms, on the chosen
   account when there is one; an email opens its thread; any other item opens
   in place, with its link when it has one. Edit opens `OrganizationFormModal`;
   ⋯ archives (`POST /organizations/bulk/`) or churns
   (`ChurnOrganizationModal`). A tile jumps to its Details panel; Health opens
   its breakdown. An id that is not a number, or one the viewer cannot see,
   says "Organization not found".
6. Ask Revenact on this page is delivery 3 of that spec; there is no Ask link
   here meanwhile.
```

Replace:
```markdown
Shared by both detail pages. Five top tabs and thirteen filter chips.
```
with:
```markdown
The account page's (`/accounts/:id`) feed. The organization page replaced it
with the Story (§ Organizations, step 5). Five top tabs and thirteen filter
chips.
```

In the placeholders table, replace:
```markdown
| Success Plans tab on both detail pages | "Coming Soon" |
| Activity feed: Pulse, Conversations, Revenact Support | "coming soon" |
| Activity feed: search box, "Add Action", filter icon | No handler |
```
with:
```markdown
| Success Plans tab on the account page | "Coming Soon" |
| Account page feed: Pulse, Conversations, Revenact Support | "coming soon" |
| Account page feed: search box, "Add Action", filter icon | No handler |
```

- [ ] **Step 2: `docs/03-ui-ux-design.md`**

Replace:
```markdown
### Overlays

`HealthPopover` (five real rubric components with weights), `CsatPopover`
(response bands at true scale), the Organizations
`FiltersPanel` and `PinFieldsMenu`, `ContactRowActionsPopover`, and the Navbar's notification
and account menus. All close on an outside `mousedown`.
```
with:
```markdown
### Organization page (`/organizations/:id`)

The organization's story, framed like the list (transparent top bar with
"‹ Organizations", `OrganizationsFrame`, no rail until Ask arrives in delivery 3).
Rules specific to it, enforced by `components/organizations/detail/houseRules.test.ts`
(which also scans `pages/organizations/Details.tsx`):

- Name row: initials in a `bg-subtle` circle (never a third-party logo), the
  name at 22px, "owner · lifecycle · Touched Nd ago" at 13px, the signal tag,
  then Edit and a ⋯ menu (Archive, Churn while they apply).
- Tiles: Health (ring and trend; opens the five-part breakdown below the
  tiles), ARR (in the customer's own currency), Renewal (runway) and Pulse
  ("AI n · CSM n", dots, "pulses disagree"). Each is a button; the last three
  jump to their Details panel. A grid of four from `sm`, a snapping strip below.
- Account chips (All, each account, Organization) carry only a name and the
  story's count; the chosen one is `bg-accent text-on-accent`.
- Details opens with Accounts: one `bg-surface` list, an item per connected
  account (name linking to its page, owner · domain, "AI n", the AI label,
  the pulse dots, the AI reason, Edit), with Add account in its heading.
- Tabs are a real tablist (`role="tab"`, roving tab index, arrows, Home, End),
  underlined like the Navbar's views.
- Story: Needs attention (each row says what it is in words and goes to it),
  the filters with counts, Sources, search and "+ Add", then the stream: days
  as small uppercase headings, each day one `bg-surface` list with dividers,
  in the Communications inbox's manner. An item is a Lucide icon in a circle,
  its title, the time in DM Mono, a one-line summary, then the account tag and
  "kind · who · via source". No card in a card.
- Every one of the 34 table fields renders once across the name row, the
  tiles and Details (`detail/fieldCoverage.test.tsx`).

### Overlays

The Organizations `FiltersPanel` and `PinFieldsMenu`, `ContactRowActionsPopover`,
the organization page's `Menu` (⋯ and + Add) and `SourcesPicker`, and the Navbar's
notification and account menus. All close on an outside `mousedown`; the
organization page's also close on Escape and hand focus back to their button.
The organization page's `Sheet` (+ Add, an email's thread) is modal: a
right-hand panel from `sm`, a bottom sheet below it, with a focus trap, the
page's scroll locked, and focus returned to what opened it.
```

Replace:
```markdown
`ActivityFeed` is the largest shared component: five top tabs (Activity Feed,
Headlines, Overview, Files, CallSense) and thirteen filter chips.
```
with:
```markdown
`ActivityFeed` (the account page only, since the organization page's Story
replaced it there) is the largest shared component: five top tabs (Activity
Feed, Headlines, Overview, Files, CallSense) and thirteen filter chips.
```

In §10, replace:
```markdown
and follows a swipe. Cards do not drag there; each card's Move to… menu moves
it, and a tapped card opens in the bottom sheet. Every control is 44px.
```
with:
```markdown
and follows a swipe. Cards do not drag there; each card's Move to… menu moves
it, and a tapped card opens in the bottom sheet. Every control is 44px.

The organization page below `sm`: the name row, the tiles as a strip that
snaps sideways, the account chips and the tabs each scroll sideways in their
own row, and the content is full width. "+ Add" and an email's thread open as
bottom sheets. Every control is 44px.
```

In §12, replace:
```markdown
| 11 | Navbar and ActivityFeed have controls with no handlers | Search, Plus, Help, Message, feed search, "Add Action", title chevrons |
```
with:
```markdown
| 11 | Navbar and the account page's ActivityFeed have controls with no handlers | Search, Plus, Help, Message, feed search, "Add Action", title chevrons |
```

- [ ] **Step 3: `.agents/workflows/repo-architecture.md`**

Replace:
```markdown
│   └── :id                    → Organization Details page (full detail)
```
with:
```markdown
│   └── :id                    → Organization page (Details.tsx: the story, on GET /organizations/{id}/story/)
```

Replace everything from the heading `#### Details View (\`pages/organizations/Details.tsx\`)` down to (not including) the `---` line above `### 4. Accounts (\`pages/accounts/Details.tsx\`)` with:
```markdown
#### Details View (`pages/organizations/Details.tsx`)
The organization's story (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-organization-detail-design.md`,
delivery 1). It draws itself in `OrganizationsFrame` (no rail until delivery 3).

- **Reads:** `useOrganization` (the portfolio row by `ids` plus `GET /customers/{id}/`),
  `fetchAccountsForCustomer` (the chips) and `useStory` (`GET /organizations/{id}/story/`,
  cursor-paged). Four requests on landing; the other tabs read when first opened.
- **URL state:** `useDetailParams` (`features/organizations/detailParams.ts`):
  `tab`, `account`, `group`, `source`, `q`.
- **Header:** `OrganizationHeader` (initials, name, owner · lifecycle · last touch,
  signal, Edit, ⋯ Archive/Churn) and `HeaderTiles` (Health with `HealthBreakdown`,
  ARR, Renewal, Pulse; each of the last three jumps to its Details panel).
- **Story:** `StoryTab` → `AttentionBlock`, `StoryToolbar` (filters, `SourcesPicker`,
  search, + Add via `Menu`), `StoryStream` → `StoryItemRow`; `EmailThread` and
  `AddFlow` open in a `Sheet`. `AddFlow` reuses `TaskForm`, `NoteForm`, `CallForm`
  and `LogSurveyForm` from `components/organizations/activity/`.
- **Other tabs:** `DetailsTab` (`AccountsSection`, portfolio `AccountDetails` + `AIAttributesPanel`),
  `PeopleTab` (`ContactsTab`), `DealsTab` (`PipelinesTab`), `KnowledgeTab`
  (`CompanyViewTab` + `HeadlinesTab`), `FilesCallsTab` (`FilesTab` + `CallSenseTab`).
- **Tests:** unit tests beside each part in `components/organizations/detail/`, the
  house-rules scan and field coverage there, `Details.test.tsx` (integration with
  `testDetail.tsx`'s `renderOrganizationPage` and `testStory.ts`'s
  `stubOrganizationPage`), and `src/e2e/organizationDetail.test.tsx`.
```

Replace:
```markdown
  ├── pages/organizations/Details.tsx & pages/accounts/Details.tsx
  │     ├── components/shared/PinnedAttributes
```
with:
```markdown
  ├── pages/organizations/Details.tsx  (portfolio row, /customers/{id}/, accounts, /organizations/{id}/story/)
  │     ├── OrganizationsFrame; components/organizations/detail/* (OrganizationHeader, HeaderTiles,
  │     │     AccountChips, DetailTabs, StoryTab → AttentionBlock, StoryToolbar, StoryStream, EmailThread, AddFlow, Sheet)

  ├── pages/accounts/Details.tsx
  │     ├── components/shared/PinnedAttributes
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Check the old wording is gone, and commit**

Run: `grep -n "dispatches six parallel fetches\|HealthPopover\|CsatPopover\|Organization Details page (full detail)" docs/04-app-flow.md docs/03-ui-ux-design.md .agents/workflows/repo-architecture.md || echo updated`
Expected: `updated`.

```bash

### Task 21: Full checks

**Files:** none, unless a check fails. A fix goes back into the task that owns the behaviour and gets its own commit.

- [ ] **Step 1: Static and test gates**

Run each and read the output:
```bash
npm run lint                              # expected: 0 errors; no new warnings in files this plan touched
npx tsc -b --noEmit                       # expected: no output
npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2             # expected: every file passes, including src/e2e/organizationDetail.test.tsx
npm run build                             # expected: vite build completes
```
To check the warnings: `npx eslint $(git diff --name-only main -- 'src/**/*.ts' 'src/**/*.tsx')` reports none.

- [ ] **Step 2: The house anti-slop scan on the touched files**

```bash
git diff main --name-only --diff-filter=AM -- 'src/**/*.tsx' | grep -v '\.test\.' | xargs grep -nE '#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,6}\b|rgba?\(|text-white|text-(blue|rose|purple|amber|emerald|red|green)-|clearbit|pravatar' || echo "no raw colours or third-party images"
```
Expected: hits only in `src/components/organizations/activity/*.tsx`, `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` and `src/pages/surveys/SurveysPage.tsx` from lines this plan did not write (their existing classes), or `no raw colours or third-party images`. Anything in `src/components/organizations/detail/` or `src/pages/organizations/Details.tsx` is a failure to fix; `detail/houseRules.test.ts` already enforces them.

- [ ] **Step 3: The removals held**

```bash
grep -rnE "ActivityFeed|PinnedAttributes|SlackTab|logo\.clearbit|pravatar|Enable new 360 UI|Ask Copilot" src/pages/organizations/Details.tsx src/components/organizations/detail || echo "removed"
grep -rn "HealthPopover\|CsatPopover" src || echo "deleted"
```
Expected: `removed` and `deleted`.

### Task 22: Browser check at desktop and 375px, both themes (controller)

**Files:** none, unless a check fails (then fix it in the owning task, with a commit). The controller does this task, not a subagent.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run both apps**

- Backend: `../revenact-backend` with the story endpoint merged (the companion backend PR), on `http://localhost:8000`, seeded with an organization that has two accounts, a synced email thread on one account, a Zendesk ticket, a call with a CallSense summary, an overdue task, an unanswered Knowledge question and a month of HealthSnapshots; and one archived, one churned organization.
- Frontend: `npm run dev` (Vite on `http://localhost:5173`), signed in once as a CSM with `view_all_accounts` and once as a CSM without it (to see a withheld anomaly title and department-scoped tickets).

- [ ] **Step 2: Desktop, 1440×900, light theme**

Drive it with `npm run pw` (playwright-cli) or Claude in Chrome. From `/organizations/list`, open the seeded organization:
1. The top bar is transparent: "‹ Organizations", then the bell, no avatar, no bordered bar. No page-level horizontal scroll. DevTools' Network tab shows four requests on landing.
2. The name row: initials (no image), the name, "owner · lifecycle · Touched Nd ago", the signal, Edit and ⋯. The tiles agree with the List's row for the same organization (health, trend, runway, pulse); ARR is in the customer's currency.
3. Health opens the five-part breakdown; ARR, Renewal and Pulse land on their Details panels with a focus ring on the panel. Details opens with Accounts: each connected account as an item (name, owner, domain, AI score and reason, pulse dots), its name opening `/accounts/:id`, Edit and Add account opening the account form.
4. The chips read "All n · <accounts> · Organization n"; choosing one narrows the story and puts `?account=` in the URL; refresh keeps it. Add account and Edit <account> open the account form.
5. Needs attention shows each row in words; its rows go to Tickets, Tasks & notes, Knowledge and the contract panel.
6. Filters, Sources and search each narrow the story and survive a refresh and Back. Clear filters empties them.
7. + Add → New task saves and the task appears at the top of the story (on the chosen account when one is chosen); likewise New note, Log a call and Log survey.
8. The email opens its thread (only real messages, oldest first); Escape returns focus to the email. The ticket opens in place with "Open in Zendesk" (new tab).
9. Scroll to the end: the next page loads before the end; Show more is still there.
10. Tab through the page: every tile, chip, tab (arrows move), filter, menu item and story title shows a focus ring.
11. ⋯ → Archive shows the reason if refused; on the archived organization ⋯ offers only Churn; the churned one offers only Archive.

- [ ] **Step 3: Phone, 375×812, light theme**

1. Name row, tile strip (snaps sideways), chips and tabs each scroll in their own row; no horizontal page scroll. On Details, each account item wraps (Edit under its details) with no sideways scroll.
2. + Add and an email open as bottom sheets with a focus trap; the page behind does not scroll.
3. Every control is at least 44px (chips, filters, tabs, Sources, Add, menu items, Close).

- [ ] **Step 4: Dark theme, both widths**

Switch the theme in Settings > Personalization and repeat 2.1-2.8 and 3.1-3.2. Check that tiles, chips (the chosen one is ink on white), the stream, the breakdown bars, the sheet and its scrim all use tokens (nothing stays light), and danger, warning and success tones stay readable on `bg-surface`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Record and stop**

Save screenshots at 1440 and 375 in both themes for the PR description. Then the branch is ready for `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`. Do not push.

**Placeholder scan:** no step says "TBD", "handle edge cases" or "similar to Task N". Every code step has its code; every test step has its test; every edit names the exact text it replaces, or the exact start and end of the block it replaces where the old block carries trailing whitespace (the Navbar branch, the `Details View` section).

**Type consistency, checked across tasks:**
- `StoryGroup`, `StoryKind`, `StoryActor`, `StoryLink`, `StoryItem`, `StoryAttention`, `StoryCounts`, `StoryResponse` (Task 1) mirror the backend (`items.py`, `build.py`, backend plan Task 7) and are used by Tasks 2, 4, 8-11, 14 and the stub. `STORY_GROUPS`, `STORY_KINDS`, `KIND_GROUP`, `KIND_NAME`, `kindsIn`, `offeredSources`, `sourceName`, `isStoryKind`, `isStoryGroup`, `ADD_FLOWS`, `AddKind` (Task 1) are used by Tasks 2, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14.
- `storyQuery(f: StoryFilters, limit?)` and `fetchStory(orgId, query, cursor?)` (Task 1) are used by `useStory` (Task 4) and the page (Task 16) with `storyFilters(params)` (Task 2); `fetchThread(orgId, threadId)` (Task 1) by `EmailThread` (Task 11), which `StoryTab` (Task 14) opens only for an email whose `link.thread_id` is set.
- `dayKey`, `timeLabel` and `groupByDay` (Task 2) take items (`{occurred_at, all_day}`), as `StoryItemRow` and `StoryStream` (Task 10) pass them.
- `DetailParams`, `DetailTab`, `DETAIL_TABS`, `parseDetailParams`, `withPatch`, `hasStoryFilters`, `detailTabId`, `detailPanelId` (Task 2) are used by Tasks 7, 8, 14 and 16; `useDetailParams().update(patch, {replace})` is `StoryTab`'s `onUpdate`.
- `useOrganization(id, version)` → `{row, customer, loading, notFound, error, customerError, retry}` and `useStory(orgId, query, version, enabled)` → `StoryState` (Task 4) are used by the page (Task 16); `StoryState` by `StoryStream` (Task 10) and `StoryTab` (Task 14).
- `Sheet({title, description, isSm, onClose, children})` (Task 3) is used by `EmailThread` (Task 11) and `AddFlow` (Task 13). `Menu({label, trigger, triggerClassName, items, align})` (Task 5) is used by `OrganizationHeader` (Task 5) and `StoryToolbar` (Task 9).
- `HeaderTiles`' and `AttentionBlock`'s `onJump(panel: PanelKey)` meet the page's `jumpTo` (Task 16); `AttentionBlock`'s `onFilter(group)` and `onOpenTab(tab)` meet `StoryTab`'s `onUpdate({group})` and the page's `update({tab})`.
- `TaskForm`, `NoteForm`, `CallForm`, `LogSurveyForm` (Task 12) take `onDone`/`onLogged`, which `AddFlow` (Task 13) passes as `onAdded`.
- `makeDetailStore()` (Task 12) is used by Tasks 13-16 and the moved tests; `renderOrganizationPage(url, {width, nav, list})` (Task 16) by Task 19.
- `stubOrganizationPage`, `storyQueries`, `portfolioRequests`, `postBodies`, `requestPaths` (Task 1) take the stub's spy structurally (`Calls`), so no test mixes it with `testPortfolio`'s typed spy helpers.
