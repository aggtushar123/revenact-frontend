# Pipelines portfolio (frontend, delivery 1) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Replace `/pipelines/list` and `/pipelines/board` with one book of opportunities or risks across organisations and accounts, in the portfolio design (tiles with a stage strip, URL filters, list items with a Part-of line and a date line, a stage Board, selection with bulk edits, export), on `GET /api/v1/pipelines/{opportunities,risks}/`; give the forms the date and Closed Lost, and the Deals & risks tabs the date line and the Overdue signal.

**Architecture:**
- Pipelines is its **own portfolio module** (`src/features/pipelines/`, `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/`, `src/pages/pipelines/{List,Board}.tsx`) with two kind configs, `OPPORTUNITIES_KIND` and `RISKS_KIND` (a `PipelineKind`, not a `PortfolioKind`: see Decision 1).
- It reuses the Organizations/Accounts portfolio wherever the shapes allow. Tasks 1–3 first extract the shape-agnostic parts of `src/components/organizations/portfolio/` without changing their behaviour: the cursor-paged read (`usePagedRead`), the tile, filter-sheet, group/sort, chip-row, Move-to menu, search-box and selection-bar primitives. Organizations and Accounts keep their DOM and their tests.
- The page reads `?kind=` (default opportunities, omitted) and remounts per kind. The List and the Board share every other URL parameter; both group by stage by default.
- An item or card opens the existing `OpportunityFormModal` / `RiskFormModal`, built from the row (no extra read). A Board move is the existing `PATCH /opportunities/<id>/` or `/risks/<id>/` (the slice's `updateOpportunity` / `updateRisk`).
- The page wears the framed layout (transparent bar with Pipelines, List | Board, Opportunities | Risks, the actions slot, no avatar) in `OrganizationsFrame` with its rail slot left empty (Ask is delivery 2).

**Tech Stack:** React 19 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind v4 tokens, Redux Toolkit, react-router 7, lucide-react, Vitest + Testing Library (jsdom).

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-pipelines-redesign-design.md` §1 (the list and Board), §4 (delivery), §5 (frontend testing), with three rulings made during the backend build that amend it (below). The backend contract is the `revenact-backend` branch `feat/pipelines-portfolio` (`docs/API_CONTRACTS.md` → `pipelines_portfolio`, and the Opportunity / Risk sections; `services/pipelines_portfolio/{params,book,shape,rows,views,serializers}.py`). It merges and deploys **before** this frontend.

## Global Constraints

- **The owner's standing rules (spec §0):** "app-ready (phones included), never spreadsheet-like, and no information lost."
- **Shape (spec Decisions):** "One book of opportunities or risks across organisations **and** accounts. Each item names its organisation or account. The Deals & risks tabs on the organisation and account pages stay as they are, gaining the date."
- **Frame (spec §1):** "a transparent top bar with **Pipelines**, the **List | Board** switch, an **Opportunities | Risks** switch, the (delivery 2) Ask button and the bell; the content column scrolls on its own; an empty rail slot for delivery 2. Routes stay `/pipelines/list` and `/pipelines/board`; the kind is `?kind=opportunities|risks` (default opportunities, omitted)."
- **Tiles (spec §1):** "Opportunities: Open pipeline (count · MRR) · Closing in 30 / 90 days · Overdue · Won this quarter (count · MRR) · a stage strip (count per open stage). Risks: MRR at risk (open count · MRR) · Due in 30 / 90 days · Overdue · Mitigated this quarter · a stage strip." "A tile sets its filter; tapping it again clears it. Totals cover every filtered row, not the page."
- **Ruling (backend build):** "The tiles ignore only the stage filter; every other filter applies. The server's `summary.stages` lists every stage (Board column headers incl. Closed Won/Lost); the page's stage strip shows OPEN stages only from that list."
- **Toolbar (spec §1):** Search "title, and the organisation or account name"; Group "stage (Board and List default), close month (`2026-10`, …, *Overdue*, *No date*), organisation or account, owner (with Unassigned), department, priority, or none"; Sort "MRR, close date, priority, stage, title; missing values last"; Filters "organisation, account, owner (with Unassigned), stage (open stages by default; closed stages opt-in), priority, department, closes or is due within 30/90/180 days, overdue, no date"; "**Export CSV**, **+ Add** and selection with bulk **Set stage / priority / department / date**, as on Accounts. Everything lives in the URL."
- **Ruling (backend build):** "Close-month groups order: Overdue first, months ascending, No date last."
- **Ruling (backend build):** "Owner filter values: a user id, `unassigned`, `outside` ("Not in your book"); row/group owners outside the viewer's organisation read "Not in your book"; group=owner has an "outside" section after named people and before Unassigned."
- **List items (spec §1):** "never a table"; "the title; beneath it **Part of** the organisation or account (a link…)"; "MRR in the workspace currency, the stage tag, priority, department"; "the date: "Closes in 12d", "Overdue 5d", or "No date" (risks: "Due in …")"; "a signal tag at most: *Overdue* first, then *High priority* on an open item." "Clicking an item opens it (the existing Opportunity / Risk form, with the new date and Closed Lost). Phones: one column, the item's facts wrap under the title, 44px targets."
- **Board (spec §1):** "Columns by stage (Closed Lost shown for opportunities, collapsed by default), the same item content as cards; dragging a card sets its stage."
- **Add (spec §1):** "Pick where it belongs: an organisation or an account (only ones the viewer may open), then title, MRR, stage, priority, department and the date."
- **Removed (spec §1):** "The Count/MRR toggle, the stat-card banner, the page's `<table>` list views, the client-side filter popover and client totals, and the unused `components/shared/PipelinesTab.tsx` (with its tests)."
- **Deals & risks (spec §1):** "Their **Deals & risks** tabs keep their layout; each item gains the date line and the Overdue signal; the forms gain the date and Closed Lost."
- **Testing (spec §5):** "unit tests for rows, tiles and params; integration through the real store and router with `fetch` stubbed in contract shapes; a jsdom journey per delivery; the house-rules suite over the new files; the Organizations, Accounts and Deals & risks tests still pass."
- **Backend contract** (`pipelines_portfolio`):
  - `GET /pipelines/{opportunities,risks}/` params: `search, organisation, account, owner (id|unassigned|outside), stage (default: open stages; "the Board sends every stage"), priority, department (none = undeparted), date (30|90|180|overdue|none), changed (quarter), ids, sort (mrr|date|priority|stage|title, "-" descending, default -mrr), group (stage|month|parent|owner|department|priority), group_value, cursor, limit`.
  - Response `{kind, results, next_cursor, count, groups: [{key,label,count,mrr}], summary: {items, mrr, open, within: {"30","90"}, overdue, done_this_quarter: {stage,count,mrr}, stages: [{value,label,count,mrr}]}, filters: {organisations, accounts, owners, stages, priorities, departments}, currency}`.
  - A row: `{id, kind, title, parent: {type: "organisation"|"account", id, name}, companies, owner: {id|null, name}|null, mrr (float), stage {value,label}, priority {value,label}, department {value,label}, date {value, days}, open, overdue, signal {kind: "overdue"|"high_priority", label}|null, stage_changed_at, created_at}`.
  - `GET …/export.csv` (same params) → `<kind>-<date>.csv`; `POST …/bulk/ {ids, action: set_stage|set_priority|set_department|set_date, value}` → `{updated, failed: [{id, reason}]}`; `set_department` takes `""` for everyone's; `set_date` takes `YYYY-MM-DD` or `null` (the key must be present).
  - `/opportunities/` and `/risks/` (list, nested, detail) read and write `expected_close` / `due_by`, return `stage_changed_at`; Opportunity gains stage `closed_lost`.
- **House rules** (`.claude/skills/revenact-design/SKILL.md` §1, §4): tokens only; type sizes 11/13/15/22 px; numbers in `font-mono-brand tabular-nums`; Lucide icons with `aria-hidden` beside text; no card in a card; 44px targets below `sm` (`min-h-11 sm:min-h-9`); designed empty, loading and error states; sentence-case copy; both themes; no motion added; no glass (the Ask rail is delivery 2).
- **Tests** per the `testing` skill: unit, integration (real store and router, `fetch` stubbed in contract shapes), a jsdom journey in `src/e2e/`, the house-rules suite. Run Vitest as `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 <paths>`, one process at a time. No new dependencies.
- Work on `feat/pipelines-redesign` in `react-ts-app`. Conventional commits (`refactor(portfolio): …`, `feat(pipelines): …`, `test(pipelines): …`, `docs(pipelines): …`) ending with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- Update the product documents in the same PR: `docs/03-ui-ux-design.md`, `docs/04-app-flow.md`, `.agents/workflows/repo-architecture.md`.

## Decisions this plan makes where the spec is silent

1. **Pipelines is its own portfolio module, not a third `PortfolioKind`.** `PortfolioKind`, `PortfolioRowBase` and `PortfolioParams` are organisation-shaped end to end (health ring, lifecycle, ARR, pulse, renewal runway, churn, `LifecycleValue` board columns); a pipeline row has none of them. Forcing it in would mean re-typing the row, the params, the board and the tiles for a third consumer.
   - **Reused unchanged:** `styles.ts`, `useSelection`, `useEndSentinel`, `useDismiss`, `useOverlayActive`, `EmptyState` / `ErrorBlock` / `MoreButton` / `sectionStartsOpen`, `countText`, `OrganizationsFrame`, `ConfirmDialog`, the two forms, `PRIORITY_COLORS`, `TITLE_BUTTON`, the test helpers (`setViewport`, `SlotHost`, `houseRuleSuite`).
   - **Extracted, behaviour-preserving (Tasks 1–3), then reused:** `usePagedRead` (the ABA-safe cursor read under `usePagedPortfolio`), `tileParts.tsx` (`Tile`, `Switch`, `FilterButton`, `TileButton`, `TilesSkeleton`), `filterParts.tsx` (`FilterSheet`, `Check`, `Radio`, `FilterGroup`, `GroupSortFields`, `FILTER_SELECT`), `ChipRow`, `MoveToMenu`, `useSearchText`, `SelectionActionsBar` (generic choices plus a date choice), `RowSkeleton`'s `label`, `BoardSkeleton`, `CardSkeleton`.
   - **Pipelines' own:** the kind configs and words (`pipelineKinds.ts`), params and chips, the item and its parts (Part-of line, date line, stage and priority tags, signal), the tiles with the stage strip, the filters panel's sections, the sections list, and the stage Board (columns per stage with Closed Lost collapsed, a card that opens the form, `usePipelineMove`). The Board mirrors `PortfolioBoard`'s settle protocol rather than sharing it; the owner may prefer a later refactor that makes `PortfolioBoard` stage-generic.
2. **An item or card opens the form, built from the row.** `opportunityRecord(row)` / `riskRecord(row)` give the form everything it reads (title, MRR, stage, priority, department, companies, account, date), so no `GET /opportunities/<id>/` is needed. There is no side panel or sheet.
3. **The Open pipeline / MRR at risk tile is a figure, not a button.** It is exactly the List's default view, so as a filter it could only ever clear nothing. The other four tiles filter and toggle.
4. **A closed item past its date** reads "Expected 5 Sep 2026" (opportunity) or "Was due 5 Sep 2026" (risk): the spec's three strings are for open items, and "Overdue" would be false on a closed one. "Closes today" / "Due today" at 0 days.
5. **The kind switch** sits in the top bar from `sm` and as the first row of the page below `sm` (the phone bar has no room beside List | Board and the bell). Switching keeps the shared filters (search, organisation, account, owner, priority, department, date, sort, group) and drops `stage`, `changed` and `ids`, which belong to one kind. Each page is keyed on the kind, so a selection, a move or an open form never crosses kinds.
6. **Stages on the Board.** With no `stage` in the URL the Board asks for every stage; the Filters panel's Stage checkboxes show the view's default checked (List: the open stages, Board: all). Closed Lost starts collapsed ("Show Closed Lost"), stays a drop target, and its open state lasts for the visit, not in the URL. Moves are allowed only when grouped by stage.
7. **Add** uses the existing form's picker: an organisation from the first page of `GET /customers/` (as Accounts' Add), then an optional account under it. An account the viewer can open only without any openable organisation cannot be picked here; its own page's Deals & risks tab adds to it.
8. **The forms call `onSaved` after every successful save** (edits and board-wide adds too, not only scoped adds), so the page reloads its book. Every existing caller passes `onSaved` only where it already wanted it.
9. **`expected_close`, `due_by` and `stage_changed_at` are optional in the TypeScript types.** The API always sends them; the older fixtures (`testStory.ts`, `testAccountPage.ts`) do not, and a missing one reads "No date".
10. **The global `fetchOpportunities` / `fetchRisks` thunks and the `opportunities` / `risks` slice state stay.** Nothing reads them after this delivery, but the Navbar test preloads that state and the create/update reducers write it; removing them is a separate cleanup.
11. **Selection is on the List only**, as on Accounts. Phones select with the toolbar's Select toggle; there is no long-press on pipeline items.
12. **The item does not show the owner.** The spec's item lists title, Part of, MRR, stage, priority, department, date and signal; the owner is the organisation's or account's, and it drives the Owner filter and grouping. For an account-level item the Part-of line adds the first organisation it belongs to that the viewer may open ("Part of Pizza Hut EMEA · Pizza Hut").
13. **Bulk edits:** Set department offers "Whole company" (sent as `""`); Set date is a date input plus a "Clear date" button (sent as `null`), each armed and applied with "Apply to N" like the other choices.
14. **The Navbar and DashboardLayout tests that used `/pipelines/board` as their example of an unframed, padded page** move to `/users`, with the same assertions; `/pipelines/list` and `/pipelines/board` join the DashboardLayout test's unpadded list.
15. **"Framed" means Accounts' List/Board frame:** `DashboardLayout` gives `<main>` no padding, the Navbar is the transparent bar, and `OrganizationsFrame` draws its own `px-4` gutter; the organisation page's `bleed` variant is not used.
16. **Settings → Pipeline attributes** (`pages/settings/pipelineAttributes.ts`) does not gain the new fields in this delivery; the spec does not list it.
17. **No doubled "High priority".** When an item's one signal is High priority, its priority tag is left out (the signal says the same thing); a closed high-priority item, which has no signal, shows the tag.

### Task 1: The cursor-paged read, given a reader and a noun

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/usePagedRead.ts`
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/usePortfolio.ts` (the `errorMessage`, `Loaded`, `MoreState`, `PagedState` and `usePagedPortfolio` definitions, lines 1–150)
- Test: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/usePagedRead.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `PortfolioNoun` (`features/organizations/portfolioLabels.ts`), `ApiError` (`lib/apiClient`).
- Produces:

```ts
// usePagedRead.ts
export function errorMessage(err: unknown, fallback: string): string;
export interface Paged<R> { results: R[]; next_cursor: string | null }
export interface PagedRead<R, P extends Paged<R>> {
  data: P | null; rows: R[]; next: string | null; loading: boolean; error: string | null;
  loadingMore: boolean; moreError: string | null; loadMore: () => Promise<void>; retry: () => void;
  loadedKey: string | null; loadedQuery: string | null;
}
export function usePagedRead<R, P extends Paged<R>>(
  read: (query: string) => Promise<P>, noun: PortfolioNoun,
  query: string, enabled: boolean, version: number, onLoaded?: (rows: R[]) => void,
): PagedRead<R, P>;
// usePortfolio.ts (unchanged names)
export { errorMessage } from './usePagedRead';
export type PagedState<R, F> = PagedRead<R, PortfolioPage<R, F>>;
export function usePagedPortfolio<R, F>(query, enabled, version, onLoaded?): PagedState<R, F>;
```

`read` and `noun` must be stable (a module-level function and object); they are effect dependencies.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```tsx
// src/components/organizations/portfolio/usePagedRead.test.tsx
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';
import { act, renderHook, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { usePagedRead } from './usePagedRead';

const NOUN = { one: 'widget', many: 'widgets' };
type Row = { id: number };
type Page = { results: Row[]; next_cursor: string | null; count: number };

describe('usePagedRead', () => {
  it('reads page one, appends the next page and reports what landed', async () => {
    const read = vi.fn(
      async (query: string): Promise<Page> =>
        query.includes('cursor=2')
          ? { results: [{ id: 3 }], next_cursor: null, count: 3 }
          : { results: [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }], next_cursor: '2', count: 3 },
    );
    const onLoaded = vi.fn();
    const { result } = renderHook(() => usePagedRead<Row, Page>(read, NOUN, 'limit=2', true, 0, onLoaded));
    expect(result.current.loading).toBe(true);
    await waitFor(() => expect(result.current.rows.map((row) => row.id)).toEqual([1, 2]));
    expect(result.current.data?.count).toBe(3);
    expect(result.current.loadedQuery).toBe('limit=2');
    await act(async () => {
      await result.current.loadMore();
    });
    expect(result.current.rows.map((row) => row.id)).toEqual([1, 2, 3]);
    expect(read).toHaveBeenLastCalledWith('limit=2&cursor=2');
    expect(onLoaded).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
  });

  it('reads nothing while disabled, and names its noun when a read fails', async () => {
    const read = vi.fn(async (): Promise<Page> => {
      throw new Error('boom');
    });
    const { result, rerender } = renderHook(
      ({ enabled }: { enabled: boolean }) => usePagedRead<Row, Page>(read, NOUN, 'q', enabled, 0),
      { initialProps: { enabled: false } },
    );
    expect(read).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
    expect(result.current.loading).toBe(false);
    rerender({ enabled: true });
    await waitFor(() => expect(result.current.error).toBe('Could not load widgets.'));
    expect(result.current.data).toBeNull();
  });

  it('reads again on retry and on a new version', async () => {
    const read = vi.fn(async (): Promise<Page> => ({ results: [], next_cursor: null, count: 0 }));
    const { result, rerender } = renderHook(({ version }: { version: number }) => usePagedRead<Row, Page>(read, NOUN, 'q', true, version), {
      initialProps: { version: 0 },
    });
    await waitFor(() => expect(result.current.loading).toBe(false));
    act(() => result.current.retry());
    await waitFor(() => expect(read).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2));
    rerender({ version: 1 });
    await waitFor(() => expect(read).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3));
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 src/components/organizations/portfolio/usePagedRead.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL — `Failed to resolve import "./usePagedRead"`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Make `usePagedPortfolio` a wrapper**

In `src/components/organizations/portfolio/usePortfolio.ts`, replace everything from the first line down to the end of `usePagedPortfolio` (the line before `export interface PortfolioState`) with:

```ts
import { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { toApiQuery, type PortfolioParams } from '../../../features/organizations/portfolioParams';
import type {
  FilterOptions,
  OrganizationFilters,
  PortfolioPage,
  PortfolioRow,
  PortfolioRowBase,
} from '../../../features/organizations/portfolioTypes';
import { usePortfolioKind } from './portfolioKind';
import { usePagedRead, type PagedRead } from './usePagedRead';

export { errorMessage } from './usePagedRead';

export const PAGE_SIZE = 50;
export const SECTION_PAGE_SIZE = 25;

export type PagedState<R extends PortfolioRowBase = PortfolioRow, F extends FilterOptions = OrganizationFilters> = PagedRead<
  R,
  PortfolioPage<R, F>
>;

/** One cursor-paged read of the kind's portfolio endpoint (`kind.fetch`):
 *  `usePagedRead` with the kind's reader and noun. */
export function usePagedPortfolio<R extends PortfolioRowBase = PortfolioRow, F extends FilterOptions = OrganizationFilters>(
  query: string,
  enabled: boolean,
  version: number,
  onLoaded?: (rows: R[]) => void,
): PagedState<R, F> {
  const kind = usePortfolioKind();
  const read = useCallback((q: string) => kind.fetch(q) as Promise<PortfolioPage<R, F>>, [kind]);
  return usePagedRead<R, PortfolioPage<R, F>>(read, kind.noun, query, enabled, version, onLoaded);
}
```

Leave `PortfolioState` and `usePortfolio` below it as they are (`PortfolioState` still `extends PagedState<R, F>`). `useRef` is no longer imported: `usePortfolio` does not use it.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the new and the existing tests**

Run: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 src/components/organizations/portfolio/usePagedRead.test.tsx src/components/organizations/portfolio/usePortfolio.test.tsx src/pages/organizations/List.test.tsx src/pages/accounts/List.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS, no existing assertion changed.

- [ ] **Step 6: Typecheck and commit**

Run: `npx tsc -b`
Expected: no errors.

```bash
git add src/components/organizations/portfolio/usePagedRead.ts src/components/organizations/portfolio/usePagedRead.test.tsx src/components/organizations/portfolio/usePortfolio.ts
git commit -m "refactor(portfolio): the cursor-paged read takes its reader and noun

### Task 2: The tile, filter, chip, menu and search primitives, shared

Every move here is a cut and paste: the Organizations and Accounts pages must render the same DOM afterwards, which their existing tests pin.

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/tileParts.tsx`, `filterParts.tsx`, `MoveToMenu.tsx`, `useSearchText.ts`
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/SummaryTiles.tsx` (imports; lines 15–102; the Renewing tile's button)
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/FiltersPanel.tsx` (whole file)
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/FilterChips.tsx` (whole file)
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/BoardCard.tsx` (whole file)
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/PortfolioToolbar.tsx` (imports; the search state block)
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/PortfolioSections.tsx` (`RowSkeleton`)
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/PortfolioBoard.tsx` (`function BoardSkeleton` → exported), `BoardColumn.tsx` (`function CardSkeleton` → exported)
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/styles.ts` (add `MONO`)
- Test: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/sharedParts.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `FOCUS`, `useDismiss`, `trapTab` (existing).
- Produces:

```ts
// tileParts.tsx
export function Tile(props: { title: string; action?: ReactNode; children: ReactNode }): JSX.Element;
export function Switch<T extends string>(props: { label: string; options: { value: T; label: string }[]; value: T; onChange: (value: T) => void }): JSX.Element;
export function FilterButton(props: { pressed: boolean; onClick: () => void; compact?: boolean; children: ReactNode }): JSX.Element;
export function TileButton(props: { pressed: boolean; label: string; onClick: () => void; children: ReactNode }): JSX.Element;
export function TilesSkeleton(props: { count?: number }): JSX.Element; // role=status "Loading summary"
// filterParts.tsx
export const FILTER_SELECT: string;
export function Check(props: { label: string; checked: boolean; onChange: () => void }): JSX.Element;
export function Radio(props: { name: string; label: string; checked: boolean; onChange: () => void }): JSX.Element;
export function FilterGroup(props: { legend: string; children: ReactNode }): JSX.Element;
export function GroupSortFields(props: { group: string; sort: string; groupOptions: { value: string; label: string }[]; sortOptions: { value: string; label: string }[]; onGroup: (value: string) => void; onSort: (sort: string) => void }): JSX.Element;
export function FilterSheet(props: { isSm: boolean; onClose: () => void; triggerRef?: RefObject<HTMLElement | null>; initialFocusRef?: RefObject<HTMLElement | null>; children: ReactNode }): JSX.Element;
// FilterChips.tsx
export interface RemovableChip<P> { key: string; label: string; patch: Partial<P> }
export function ChipRow<P>(props: { chips: RemovableChip<P>[]; status: string; onChange: (patch: Partial<P>) => void; onClearAll: () => void }): JSX.Element;
// MoveToMenu.tsx
export function MoveToMenu(props: { name: string; disabled: boolean; note: string | null; targets: { value: string; label: string }[]; onChoose: (to: string) => void }): JSX.Element;
// useSearchText.ts
export function useSearchText(committed: string, commit: (text: string) => void): [string, (text: string) => void];
// PortfolioSections.tsx
export function RowSkeleton(props: { count: number; label?: string }): JSX.Element;
// PortfolioBoard.tsx / BoardColumn.tsx
export function BoardSkeleton(props: { isSm: boolean; narrow: boolean }): JSX.Element;
export function CardSkeleton(props: { label: string; count: number }): JSX.Element;
// styles.ts

1. Replace the first line `import { useId, useState, type ReactNode } from 'react';` with `import { useState } from 'react';`.
2. Delete the line `import { FOCUS } from './styles';` and add `import { FilterButton, Switch, Tile, TileButton, TilesSkeleton } from './tileParts';` after the `usePortfolioKind` import.
3. Delete the definitions of `Tile` (with its doc comment), `Switch`, `FilterButton` and `Skeleton` (lines 15–102). Keep the two constants between them: `const only = …` and `const mono = …`.
4. Replace `if (!failed) return <Skeleton />;` with `if (!failed) return <TilesSkeleton />;`.
5. In the Renewing tile, replace the `<button type="button" aria-pressed={params.renews_within === span} … >` element (through its closing `</button>`) with:

```tsx
        <TileButton
          pressed={params.renews_within === span}
          label={`Renewing within ${span} days: ${renewing}`}
          onClick={() => onFilter({ renews_within: params.renews_within === span ? '' : span })}
        >

- [ ] **Step 9: Create `useSearchText.ts` and use it in `PortfolioToolbar.tsx`**

```ts
// src/components/organizations/portfolio/useSearchText.ts
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

/** A search box's text: what is typed shows at once, and `commit` gets it
 *  (trimmed) 300ms after typing stops. When `committed` changes from outside
 *  (a chip, "Clear all"), the box follows it (adjusted during render, not
 *  in an effect). `commit` should be stable. */
export function useSearchText(committed: string, commit: (text: string) => void): [string, (text: string) => void] {
  const [text, setText] = useState(committed);
  const [synced, setSynced] = useState(committed);
  if (committed !== synced) {
    setSynced(committed);
    setText(committed);
  }
  useEffect(() => {
    if (text.trim() === committed) return;
    const timeout = window.setTimeout(() => commit(text.trim()), 300);
    return () => window.clearTimeout(timeout);
  }, [text, committed, commit]);
  return [text, setText];
}
```

In `PortfolioToolbar.tsx`:
1. Replace the first import with `import { useCallback, useRef, useState, type RefObject } from 'react';` and add `import { useSearchText } from './useSearchText';` after the `./styles` import.
2. Replace the block from `// The box shows what is typed; …` down to the end of the `useEffect(() => { if (text.trim() === params.search) return; … }, [text, params.search, update]);` with:

```ts
  // The box shows what is typed; the URL gets it 300ms after typing stops.
  const commitSearch = useCallback((search: string) => update({ search }), [update]);
  const [text, setText] = useSearchText(params.search, commitSearch);
```

- [ ] **Step 10: The small edits**

- `PortfolioSections.tsx`: change `export function RowSkeleton({ count }: { count: number }) {` to `export function RowSkeleton({ count, label }: { count: number; label?: string }) {` and its `aria-label={`Loading ${kind.noun.many}`}` to `aria-label={label ?? `Loading ${kind.noun.many}`}`.
- `PortfolioBoard.tsx`: `function BoardSkeleton(` → `export function BoardSkeleton(`.
- `BoardColumn.tsx`: `function CardSkeleton(` → `export function CardSkeleton(`.
- `styles.ts`: append

```ts
/** Numbers and ids: DM Mono with tabular figures. */
export const MONO = 'font-mono-brand tabular-nums';
```

- [ ] **Step 11: Run the new test and every test of the files touched**

Run: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 src/components/organizations/portfolio src/pages/organizations src/pages/accounts src/components/accounts/portfolio`
Expected: PASS. No existing assertion is edited.

- [ ] **Step 12: Typecheck, lint and commit**

Run: `npx tsc -b && npx eslint src/components/organizations/portfolio`
Expected: no errors.

```bash
git add src/components/organizations/portfolio
git commit -m "refactor(portfolio): share the tile, filter sheet, chip row, move menu and search box

### Task 3: A selection bar with any choices and a date

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/SelectionActionsBar.tsx`
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/SelectionBar.tsx` (whole file: becomes a wrapper)
- Test: `src/components/organizations/portfolio/SelectionActionsBar.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `BUTTON`, `FOCUS` (styles), `Option` (portfolioTypes), `PortfolioNoun`.
- Produces:

```ts
export interface BulkReport { updated: number; failed: { id: number; name: string; reason: string }[]; error?: string }
export interface BulkChoice { key: string; label: string; options: Option[] }
export interface BulkDateChoice { key: string; label: string; clearLabel: string }
export const CLEAR_DATE = 'clear';
export function SelectionActionsBar(props: {
  count: number; noun: PortfolioNoun; choices: BulkChoice[]; dateChoice?: BulkDateChoice;
  activity: 'applying' | 'exporting' | null; loading?: boolean; report: BulkReport | null;
  onApply: (key: string, value: string) => void; onExport: () => void;
  extra?: (disabled: boolean) => ReactNode; onClose: () => void;
}): JSX.Element;
// SelectionBar.tsx keeps its props and re-exports `type BulkReport`.
```

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```tsx
// src/components/organizations/portfolio/SelectionActionsBar.test.tsx
import { describe, expect, it, vi } from 'vitest';

  },

    expect(onApply).toHaveBeenCalledWith('set_priority', 'high');
    expect(bar).toHaveFocus();
  });

  it('sets a date, or clears it with its own button', async () => {
    const onApply = renderBar();
    const bar = screen.getByRole('region', { name: 'Selection' });

    expect(within(bar).getByRole('button', { name: 'Clear date' })).toHaveAttribute('aria-pressed', 'true');
    await userEvent.click(within(bar).getByRole('button', { name: 'Apply to 2' }));
    expect(onApply).toHaveBeenLastCalledWith('set_date', CLEAR_DATE);
  });

  it('reports in the noun, naming each failure', () => {
    renderBar({ updated: 1, failed: [{ id: 42, name: 'Analytics add-on', reason: 'Not found.' }] }, 1);
    const bar = screen.getByRole('region', { name: 'Selection' });
    expect(within(bar).getByText('Updated 1 opportunity. 1 failed:')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(within(bar).getByText('Analytics add-on')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 src/components/organizations/portfolio/SelectionActionsBar.test.tsx`

### Task 4: The Pipelines contract, the two kinds, the API and the test stub

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/features/customers/customersSlice.ts` (`Opportunity`, `OpportunityWritePayload`, `Risk`, `RiskWritePayload`, lines 484–556)
- Create: `src/features/pipelines/pipelineTypes.ts`, `pipelineApi.ts`, `pipelineKinds.ts`
- Create (test only): `src/features/pipelines/testPipelines.ts`
- Test: `src/features/pipelines/pipelineKinds.test.ts`, `pipelineApi.test.ts`, `testPipelines.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `apiFetch`, `downloadAttachment`, `BulkResult`, `Option`, `PortfolioNoun`, `FUNCTION_LABELS`, `formatDate`.
- Produces:

```ts
// pipelineTypes.ts
export type PipelineKindKey = 'opportunities' | 'risks';
export interface PipelineRow { id; kind: 'opportunity' | 'risk'; title; parent: { type: 'organisation' | 'account'; id: number; name: string }; companies: { id: number; name: string }[]; owner: { id: number | null; name: string } | null; mrr: number; stage: { value: string; label: string }; priority: { value: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'; label: string }; department: { value: UserFunction | ''; label: string }; date: { value: string | null; days: number | null }; open: boolean; overdue: boolean; signal: { kind: 'overdue' | 'high_priority'; label: string } | null; stage_changed_at: string; created_at: string }
export interface PipelineTotal { count: number; mrr: number }
export interface PipelineGroup extends PipelineTotal { key: string; label: string }
export interface PipelineSummary { items: number; mrr: number; open: PipelineTotal; within: { '30': PipelineTotal; '90': PipelineTotal }; overdue: PipelineTotal; done_this_quarter: PipelineTotal & { stage: string }; stages: (PipelineTotal & { value: string; label: string })[] }
export interface PipelineFilterOptions { organisations: Option[]; accounts: Option[]; owners: Option[]; stages: Option[]; priorities: Option[]; departments: Option[] }
export interface PipelinePage { kind: PipelineKindKey; results: PipelineRow[]; next_cursor: string | null; count: number; groups: PipelineGroup[]; summary: PipelineSummary; filters: PipelineFilterOptions; currency: CurrencyCode }
export type PipelineBulkAction = 'set_stage' | 'set_priority' | 'set_department' | 'set_date';
export interface PipelineBulkRequest { ids: number[]; action: PipelineBulkAction; value: string | null }
// pipelineApi.ts
export function fetchPipeline(kind: PipelineKindKey, query: string): Promise<PipelinePage>;
export function exportPipeline(kind: PipelineKindKey, query: string, today?: Date): Promise<void>;
export function bulkUpdatePipeline(kind: PipelineKindKey, body: PipelineBulkRequest): Promise<BulkResult>;
// pipelineKinds.ts
export interface Choice { value: string; label: string }
export interface PipelineKind { key; item; noun: PortfolioNoun; title: string; stages: Choice[]; openStages: string[]; doneStage: string; collapsedStages: string[]; dateLabel: string; dateVerb: string; pastLabel: string; sortDateLabel: string; monthLabel: string; tiles: { open: string; within: string; done: string }; fetch: (query: string) => Promise<PipelinePage> }
export const OPPORTUNITY_STAGES, RISK_STAGES, OPPORTUNITIES_KIND, RISKS_KIND, PIPELINE_KINDS, PRIORITY_CHOICES, DEPARTMENT_CHOICES, NO_DEPARTMENT;
export function stageLabel(kind, value): string; export function stageTargets(kind): Option[]; export function withArticle(word: string): string;
export function pipelineSortOptions(kind): Choice[]; export function pipelineGroupOptions(kind, board: boolean): Choice[];
export function parentHref(parent: PipelineRow['parent']): string;
export function dateText(kind, date: PipelineRow['date'], open: boolean): string;
export function daysFrom(iso: string, today: string): number;
export function rowWithStage(row: PipelineRow, to: string, kind: PipelineKind): PipelineRow;
export function opportunityRecord(row: PipelineRow): Opportunity; export function riskRecord(row: PipelineRow): Risk;
export function dealDateLine(deal: Opportunity | Risk, today: string): { text: string; overdue: boolean };
// testPipelines.ts (test only)
export const STUB_TODAY = '2026-09-30', QUARTER_START = '2026-07-01';
export const emeaSeats, analyticsAddOn, globexUplift, initechWin, hooliPilot, adminLeft, budgetFreeze, championMitigated: PipelineRow;

export function pipelineQueries(spy, kind): URLSearchParams[];
export function pipelineBulkBodies(spy, kind): PipelineBulkRequest[];
export function recordWrites(spy): { method: string; path: string; body: Record<string, unknown> | null }[];
```

- [ ] **Step 1: The new fields on the existing types**

In `src/features/customers/customersSlice.ts`:

1. In `Opportunity`, replace the `stage` union with

```ts
  stage: 'discovery' | 'qualification' | 'solution_validation' | 'proposal_price_review' |
    'negotiation' | 'closed_won' | 'closed_lost';
```

and add after `account_id?: number | null;`:

```ts
  /** Expected close, YYYY-MM-DD, or null ("No date"). The API always sends
   *  it (since 2026-09-30); optional because older fixtures omit it. */
  expected_close?: string | null;
  /** When the stage last changed (creation included). Read-only. */
  stage_changed_at?: string;
```

2. In `OpportunityWritePayload`, add `expected_close?: string | null;`.
3. In `Risk`, add after `account_id?: number | null;`:

```ts
  /** Due by, YYYY-MM-DD, or null ("No date"). The API always sends it
   *  (since 2026-09-30); optional because older fixtures omit it. */
  due_by?: string | null;
  /** When the stage last changed (creation included). Read-only. */
  stage_changed_at?: string;

### Task 5: The URL state and the chips

**Files:**
- Create: `src/features/pipelines/pipelineParams.ts`, `src/features/pipelines/pipelineChips.ts`
- Create: `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/usePipelineParams.ts`
- Test: `src/features/pipelines/pipelineParams.test.ts`, `src/features/pipelines/pipelineChips.test.ts`, `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/usePipelineParams.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `PIPELINE_KINDS`, `NO_DEPARTMENT`, `PipelineKind` (Task 4); `MAX_IDS`, `toggleIn` (`features/organizations/portfolioParams`); `countText` stays in `features/organizations/filterChips`.
- Produces:

```ts

export const DEFAULT_PIPELINE_SORT = '-mrr'; export const DEFAULT_PIPELINE_GROUP: PipelineGroupKey = 'stage';
export const EMPTY_PIPELINE_FILTERS: Partial<PipelineParams>;
export function parsePipelineParams(search: URLSearchParams): PipelineParams;

export interface PipelineChip { key: string; label: string; patch: Partial<PipelineParams> }
export function pipelineChips(p: PipelineParams, options: PipelineFilterOptions | null, kind: PipelineKind): PipelineChip[];

### Task 6: The item parts, the forms' date and Closed Lost, and the Deals & risks date line

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/itemParts.tsx`
- Modify: `src/components/pipelines/kanbanConfig.ts` (the two `*_STAGE_COLUMNS` arrays)
- Modify: `src/components/pipelines/OpportunityFormModal.tsx`, `src/components/pipelines/RiskFormModal.tsx`
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/detail/DealItem.tsx`
- Test: `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/itemParts.test.tsx`, `src/components/pipelines/pipelineForms.test.tsx`, `src/components/organizations/detail/DealItem.test.tsx` (one test added)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `parentHref`, `dealDateLine`, `OPPORTUNITY_STAGES`, `RISK_STAGES`, `PipelineRow` (Task 4); `PRIORITY_COLORS`; `localDay` (`features/organizations/storyDays`); `stubPipelines`, `recordWrites` (Task 4).
- Produces:

```ts
// itemParts.tsx
export function PipelineSignal(props: { signal: PipelineRow['signal'] }): JSX.Element | null;
export function DateLine(props: { text: string; overdue: boolean }): JSX.Element;
export function StageTag(props: { label: string }): JSX.Element;
export function PriorityTag(props: { priority: PipelineRow['priority'] }): JSX.Element;
export function PartOf(props: { row: PipelineRow }): JSX.Element;
// DealItem.tsx
export function DealItem(props: { deal: Opportunity | Risk; onOpen: () => void; today?: string }): JSX.Element;
// Both forms: a date field ("Expected close" / "Due by"); Closed Lost; `onSaved` after every successful save.
```

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

    expect(screen.getByText('Due in 20d')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('No date')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run tests to verify they fail**

Run: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 src/components/pipelines src/components/organizations/detail/DealItem.test.tsx`
Expected: FAIL — `./itemParts` unresolved; no "Expected close" field; no date line.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write `itemParts.tsx`**

```tsx
// src/components/pipelines/portfolio/itemParts.tsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { parentHref } from '../../../features/pipelines/pipelineKinds';
import type { PipelineRow } from '../../../features/pipelines/pipelineTypes';
import { FOCUS } from '../../organizations/portfolio/styles';
import { PRIORITY_COLORS } from '../kanbanConfig';

// The pieces of a Pipelines item and card (spec §1 "List items"), also used
// by the organisation and account pages' Deals & risks items.

const SIGNAL_TONE = {
  overdue: 'bg-danger-dim text-danger',
  high_priority: 'bg-warning-dim text-warning',
} as const;

/** At most one: Overdue first, then High priority on an open item. */
export function PipelineSignal({ signal }: { signal: PipelineRow['signal'] }) {
  if (!signal) return null;
  return (
    <span data-field="signal" className={`inline-flex shrink-0 rounded-full px-2 py-0.5 text-[11px] font-semibold ${SIGNAL_TONE[signal.kind]}`}>
      {signal.label}
    </span>
  );
}

/** "Closes in 12d", "Overdue 5d", "No date" (dateText), danger when overdue. */
export function DateLine({ text, overdue }: { text: string; overdue: boolean }) {
  return (
    <span data-field="date" className={`font-mono-brand tabular-nums text-[11px] ${overdue ? 'font-semibold text-danger' : 'text-ink-muted'}`}>
      {text}

export function StageTag({ label }: { label: string }) {
  return (
    <span data-field="stage" className="inline-flex shrink-0 rounded-full bg-subtle px-2 py-0.5 text-[11px] text-ink">
      {label}

      {priority.label} priority
    </span>
  );
}

/** "Part of Pizza Hut EMEA · Pizza Hut": the item's organisation or account
 *  as a link (the server sends a row only when the viewer may open it), and
 *  for an account-level item the first organisation of that account the

export function PartOf({ row }: { row: PipelineRow }) {
  const organisation = row.parent.type === 'account' ? row.companies[0]?.name : undefined;
  return (
    <p className="min-w-0 truncate text-[11px] text-ink-muted">
      Part of{' '}
      <Link
        to={parentHref(row.parent)}
        draggable={false}
        onClick={(event) => event.stopPropagation()}
        data-field="parent"
        className={`inline-flex min-h-11 items-center rounded-sm text-ink underline-offset-2 hover:underline sm:min-h-0 ${FOCUS}`}
      >
        {row.parent.name}
      </Link>
      {organisation ? ` · ${organisation}` : null}
    </p>
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: The stage columns come from the kinds**

In `src/components/pipelines/kanbanConfig.ts`, add `import { OPPORTUNITY_STAGES, RISK_STAGES } from '../../features/pipelines/pipelineKinds';` and replace the two literal arrays with:

```ts
// Opportunity.Stage / Risk.Stage on the backend, in board order (Closed
// Lost included since 2026-09-30), named once in pipelineKinds.ts.
export const OPPORTUNITY_STAGE_COLUMNS: { stage: Opportunity['stage']; title: string }[] = OPPORTUNITY_STAGES.map(({ value, label }) => ({
  stage: value,
  title: label,
}));

export const RISK_STAGE_COLUMNS: { stage: Risk['stage']; title: string }[] = RISK_STAGES.map(({ value, label }) => ({ stage: value, title: label }));
```

- [ ] **Step 5: The opportunity form gains the date, Closed Lost and `onSaved` after every save**

In `src/components/pipelines/OpportunityFormModal.tsx`:

1. Delete the `// Matches Opportunity.Stage …` comment and the `STAGE_OPTIONS` constant; add `import { OPPORTUNITY_STAGES } from '../../features/pipelines/pipelineKinds';` and change `{STAGE_OPTIONS.map((opt) => (` to `{OPPORTUNITY_STAGES.map((opt) => (`.
2. Replace the `onSaved` prop's doc comment with:

```ts
  /** Called after every successful save (an add or an edit), so the caller
   * can read its own list again: the Deals & risks tab after a scoped add,
   * the Pipelines page after any add or edit (plan 2026-10-01 Decision 8). */
```

3. After `const [priority, setPriority] = …;` add:

```ts
  const [closeDate, setCloseDate] = useState(opportunity?.expected_close ?? '');
```

4. Replace `const data = { title: title.trim(), mrr: mrr.trim() || '0', stage, priority, department };` with:

```ts
    const data = { title: title.trim(), mrr: mrr.trim() || '0', stage, priority, department, expected_close: closeDate || null };
```

5. Delete both `onSaved?.();` lines inside the branches, and change the `onClose();` that follows the branches (inside `try`) to:

```ts
      onSaved?.();
      onClose();
```

   Replace the edit branch's comment `// No onSaved() — updateOpportunity's own extraReducers already` / `// patch every list this Opportunity could be showing in.` with `// updateOpportunity's own extraReducers patch every list this Opportunity` / `// could be showing in; onSaved() below reloads a page's own book.`

6. After the Stage `SelectField` (its closing `</SelectField>`), add:

```tsx
          <DateField label="Expected close" value={closeDate} onChange={setCloseDate} />
```

7. After the `TextField` component at the bottom of the file, add:

```tsx
function DateField({ label, value, onChange }: { label: string; value: string; onChange: (value: string) => void }) {
  const id = useId();
  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor={id} className="block text-[12px] font-semibold text-ink-muted mb-1">
        {label}
      </label>
      <input
        id={id}
        type="date"
        value={value}
        onChange={(e) => onChange(e.target.value)}
        className="w-full px-3 py-2 bg-subtle border border-line rounded-lg text-[13px] text-ink focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-accent/10 focus:border-accent transition-all"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 6: The risk form, the same way**

In `src/components/pipelines/RiskFormModal.tsx`, the same six changes with the risk's names:
1. `STAGE_OPTIONS` → `import { RISK_STAGES } from '../../features/pipelines/pipelineKinds';` and `{RISK_STAGES.map((opt) => (`.
2. The `onSaved` doc comment as above.
3. `const [dueBy, setDueBy] = useState(risk?.due_by ?? '');` after the priority state.
4. `const data = { title: title.trim(), mrr: mrr.trim() || '0', stage, priority, department, due_by: dueBy || null };`
5. The same `onSaved?.();` move (and the edit branch's comment: "updateRisk's own extraReducers patch every list this Risk could be showing in; onSaved() below reloads a page's own book.").
6. `<DateField label="Due by" value={dueBy} onChange={setDueBy} />` after the Stage select, and the same `DateField` component.

- [ ] **Step 7: The Deals & risks item gains the date line**

Replace `src/components/organizations/detail/DealItem.tsx` with:

```tsx
import { useOrgCurrency } from '../../../hooks';
import type { Opportunity, Risk } from '../../../features/customers/customersSlice';
import { formatMoney } from '../../../features/customers/formatters';
import { localDay } from '../../../features/organizations/storyDays';
import { dealDateLine } from '../../../features/pipelines/pipelineKinds';
import { PRIORITY_COLORS } from '../../pipelines/kanbanConfig';
import { DateLine, PipelineSignal } from '../../pipelines/portfolio/itemParts';
import { FOCUS } from '../portfolio/styles';
import { AccountTag } from './ListParts';
import { META } from './listStyles';

const OVERDUE = { kind: 'overdue', label: 'Overdue' } as const;

/** One opportunity or risk (spec 2026-09-27 §3): the title and its MRR,
 *  then stage, priority, department, the account tag and (pipelines spec
 *  2026-09-30 §1) the date line with the Overdue signal. The whole item
 *  opens the record's existing edit form. Priority and Overdue are the only
 *  colours: they carry severity. `today` is the viewer's (tests pin it). */
export function DealItem({ deal, onOpen, today = localDay(new Date()) }: { deal: Opportunity | Risk; onOpen: () => void; today?: string }) {
  const currency = useOrgCurrency();
  const date = dealDateLine(deal, today);
  return (
    <li data-deal={deal.id}>

- [ ] **Step 8: Run the tests, and every Deals & risks and form test**

Run: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 src/components/pipelines src/components/organizations/detail src/components/accounts/detail src/pages/organizations/DetailsLists.test.tsx src/pages/accounts/Details.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS, with the earlier assertions unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 9: Typecheck, lint and commit**

Run: `npx tsc -b && npx eslint src/components/pipelines src/components/organizations/detail`

```bash
git add src/components/pipelines src/components/organizations/detail/DealItem.tsx src/components/organizations/detail/DealItem.test.tsx

### Task 7: The book, the item and the sections

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/usePipelineBook.ts`, `PipelineItem.tsx`, `PipelineSections.tsx`
- Test: `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/usePipelineBook.test.tsx`, `PipelineItem.test.tsx`, `PipelineSections.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `usePagedRead`, `PagedRead` (Task 1); `EmptyState`, `ErrorBlock`, `MoreButton`, `RowSkeleton`, `sectionStartsOpen` (`PortfolioSections.tsx`); `TITLE_BUTTON` (`organizations/detail/listStyles.ts`); `PipelineKind`, `dateText` (Task 4); `pipelineApiQuery`, `hasPipelineFilters`, `EMPTY_PIPELINE_FILTERS` (Task 5); `itemParts` (Task 6).
- Produces:

```ts
// usePipelineBook.ts
export const PIPELINE_PAGE_SIZE = 50; export const PIPELINE_SECTION_SIZE = 25;
export interface PipelineBook extends PagedRead<PipelineRow, PipelinePage> { total: number | null }
export function usePipelineBook(kind: PipelineKind, params: PipelineParams, view: PipelineView, version: number, onLoaded?: (rows: PipelineRow[]) => void, totalVersion?: number): PipelineBook;
// PipelineItem.tsx
export interface PipelineItemProps { row: PipelineRow; kind: PipelineKind; currency: CurrencyCode; selecting: boolean; selected: boolean; selectDisabled?: boolean; atLimit?: boolean; onToggleSelect: (id: number) => void; onOpen: (row: PipelineRow) => void }
export function PipelineItem(props: PipelineItemProps): JSX.Element;
// PipelineSections.tsx
export type PipelineItemRenderer = (row: PipelineRow, state: { loading: boolean }) => ReactNode;
export function PipelineSections(props: { kind; params: PipelineParams; version: number; book: PipelineBook; currency: CurrencyCode; filtered: boolean; renderItem: PipelineItemRenderer; onRowsLoaded: (rows: PipelineRow[]) => void; onClearFilters: () => void; onAdd: () => void }): JSX.Element;

### Task 8: The tiles, with the stage strip

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/PipelineTiles.tsx`
- Test: `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/PipelineTiles.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Tile`, `Switch`, `FilterButton`, `TileButton`, `TilesSkeleton` (Task 2); `MONO` (styles); `PipelineKind` (Task 4); `PipelineParams` (Task 5); `PipelineSummary`.
- Produces:

```ts
export function PipelineTiles(props: {
  kind: PipelineKind; summary: PipelineSummary | null; failed?: boolean; currency: CurrencyCode;
  params: PipelineParams; onFilter: (patch: Partial<PipelineParams>) => void;
}): JSX.Element;
```

Tile → filter (spec §1 and the backend's "each tile is its filter's rule"): Closing/Due → `date=30|90`; Overdue → `date=overdue`; Won/Mitigated this quarter → `stage=<done>&changed=quarter`; a stage in the strip → `stage=<value>`. Pressed when the URL already says exactly that; pressing again clears it. The Open pipeline / MRR at risk tile is a figure (Decision 3).

### Task 10: The List page, its frame and the kind switch

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/usePipelineForms.ts`, `PipelineModals.tsx`, `PipelineKindSwitch.tsx`
- Create: `src/pages/pipelines/List.tsx`
- Create (test only): `src/pages/pipelines/testPages.tsx`
- Modify: `src/App.tsx` (the `/pipelines/list` route and its import)
- Modify: `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` (imports; `isPipelines`; `isFramed`; the Pipelines branch)
- Modify: `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx` (`isPipelinesView`, the `p-0` condition)
- Modify: `src/components/layout/Navbar.test.tsx`, `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.test.tsx` (the example route, Decision 14)
- Test: `src/pages/pipelines/List.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything from Tasks 1–9; `useSelection`, `OrganizationsFrame`, `ConfirmDialog`, `fetchCustomers`, `deleteOpportunity`, `deleteRisk`, `countText`.
- Produces:

```ts
// usePipelineForms.ts
export function usePipelineForms(): {
  remember: (rows: PipelineRow[]) => void; titleOf: (id: number) => string;
  editing: PipelineRow | null; openEdit: (row: PipelineRow) => void; closeEdit: () => void;
  deleting: PipelineRow | null; requestDelete: (row: PipelineRow) => void; closeDelete: () => void;
  adding: { stage?: string } | null; openAdd: (stage?: string) => void; closeAdd: () => void;
  companies: { id: number; name: string }[];
};
export type PipelineForms = ReturnType<typeof usePipelineForms>;
// PipelineModals.tsx
export function PipelineModals(props: { kind: PipelineKind; forms: PipelineForms; onSaved: () => void }): JSX.Element;
// PipelineKindSwitch.tsx
export function PipelineKindSwitch(props: { variant: 'bar' | 'page' }): JSX.Element; // nav "Opportunities or risks"
// pages/pipelines/List.tsx
export function List(): JSX.Element;

- [ ] **Step 7: Route it, and frame it**

1. `src/App.tsx`: add `import { List as PipelinesList } from './pages/pipelines/List';` beside the Accounts imports, and change `<Route path="list" element={<PipelinesPage view="list" />} />` to `<Route path="list" element={<PipelinesList />} />`. (The Board route moves in Task 11.)
2. `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx`: after the `isAccountsView` constant add

```ts
  // The Pipelines list and board wear the Organizations frame too (pipelines
  // spec 2026-09-30 §1), whose own px-4 pb-4 gutters them.
  const isPipelinesView = /^\/pipelines\/(list|board)\/?$/.test(location.pathname);
```

   and add `|| isPipelinesView` after `isAccountsView` inside the `p-0` condition.
3. `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`:
   - add `import { SM, useMediaQuery } from '../../lib/useMediaQuery';` and `import { PipelineKindSwitch } from '../pipelines/portfolio/PipelineKindSwitch';` to the imports;
   - after `const { setSlot } = useContext(NavActionsSlotContext);` add `const isSm = useMediaQuery(SM);`;
   - replace `const isPipelines = location.pathname.startsWith('/pipelines');` with

```ts
  // The Pipelines list and board wear the Organizations frame (pipelines spec
  // 2026-09-30 §1): the transparent bar, "Pipelines", List | Board carrying
  // the query, Opportunities | Risks from sm (the page shows it below sm),
  // the actions slot (empty until delivery 2's Ask) and no avatar.
  const isPipelinesView = /^\/pipelines\/(list|board)\/?$/.test(location.pathname);
```

   - add `|| isPipelinesView` to the end of `isFramed`;
   - replace the whole `) : isPipelines ? ( <> … </> ) : isSettings ? (` branch (the old ChevronDown title and the two bordered NavLinks) with:

```tsx
        ) : isPipelinesView ? (
          <div className="flex items-center gap-4 h-full">
            <h1 className="text-[17px] font-bold text-ink tracking-tight">Pipelines</h1>
            <nav aria-label="Pipelines views" className="flex items-center gap-4 h-full">
              {[
                { to: '/pipelines/list', label: 'List' },
                { to: '/pipelines/board', label: 'Board' },
              ].map((view) => (
                <NavLink
                  key={view.to}
                  // The two views share their URL state (kind, filters, sort,
                  // group), so switching tabs keeps it.
                  to={{ pathname: view.to, search: location.search }}
                  className={({ isActive }) =>
                    `h-full inline-flex items-center text-[13px] font-semibold border-b-2 transition-colors duration-[var(--dur-fast)] focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-accent ${
                      isActive ? 'border-accent text-ink' : 'border-transparent text-ink-muted hover:text-ink'
                    }`
                  }
                >
                  {view.label}
                </NavLink>
              ))}
            </nav>
            {isSm ? <PipelineKindSwitch variant="bar" /> : null}
          </div>
        ) : isSettings ? (
```

4. Move the two tests' example of an unframed page (Decision 14):

```bash
sed -i '' "s#'/pipelines/board'#'/users'#g; s#path=\"/pipelines/board\"#path=\"/users\"#; s#Pipelines Marker#Users Marker#g" src/components/layout/Navbar.test.tsx
sed -i '' "s#renderAt('/pipelines/board')#renderAt('/users')#" src/layouts/DashboardLayout.test.tsx
```

   and in `src/layouts/DashboardLayout.test.tsx` add to the `it.each` list, after `'/accounts/abc',`:

```ts
    // The Pipelines list and board, framed like Accounts' (pipelines spec
    // 2026-09-30 §1).
    '/pipelines/list',
    '/pipelines/board',
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Run the page, frame and layout tests**

Run: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 src/pages/pipelines/List.test.tsx src/components/layout src/layouts src/components/pipelines`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 9: Typecheck, lint and commit**

Run: `npx tsc -b && npx eslint src/pages/pipelines src/components/pipelines src/components/layout src/layouts src/App.tsx`

```bash
git add src/pages/pipelines/List.tsx src/pages/pipelines/List.test.tsx src/pages/pipelines/testPages.tsx src/components/pipelines/portfolio src/App.tsx src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx src/components/layout/Navbar.test.tsx src/layouts/DashboardLayout.tsx src/layouts/DashboardLayout.test.tsx
git commit -m "feat(pipelines): the List as one book of opportunities or risks, framed with both switches

### Task 11: The Board

**Files:**
- Create: `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/pipelineMove.ts`, `usePipelineMove.ts`, `PipelineCard.tsx`, `PipelineColumn.tsx`, `PipelineBoard.tsx`
- Create: `src/pages/pipelines/Board.tsx`
- Modify: `src/pages/pipelines/testPages.tsx` (the Board route), `src/App.tsx` (the `/pipelines/board` route; the `PipelinesPage` import goes)
- Test: `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/pipelineMove.test.ts`, `src/pages/pipelines/Board.test.tsx`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `useOverlayActive` (`organizations/portfolio/boardMove.ts`), `BoardSkeleton`, `CardSkeleton`, `MoveToMenu` (Task 2), `usePagedRead` (Task 1), `useEndSentinel`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorBlock`, `MoreButton`; `rowWithStage`, `stageLabel`, `withArticle`, `dateText` (Task 4); `pipelineApiQuery`, `boardPipelineParams` (Task 5); `itemParts` (Task 6); `usePipelineBook`, `PIPELINE_SECTION_SIZE` (Task 7); `PipelineTiles` (Task 8); `PipelineToolbar` (Task 9); `usePipelineForms`, `PipelineModals`, `PipelineKindSwitch`, `renderPipelines` (Task 10); `updateOpportunity`, `updateRisk`.
- Produces:

```ts
// pipelineMove.ts
export interface PipelineMove { token: number; row: PipelineRow; from: string; to: string; saved?: boolean }
export interface PipelineColumnSpec { key: string; label: string; count: number; mrr: number; collapsible: boolean }
export function pipelineColumns(group: PipelineGroupKey, groups: PipelineGroup[], kind: PipelineKind): PipelineColumnSpec[];
export function withPipelineMove(spec: PipelineColumnSpec, move: PipelineMove | null): PipelineColumnSpec;
export function withMovedPipelineRow(rows: PipelineRow[], key: string, move: PipelineMove | null, kind: PipelineKind): PipelineRow[];
// usePipelineMove.ts
export interface PipelineMoveState { move: PipelineMove | null; saving: boolean; busy: boolean; notice: string | null; error: string | null; moveTo: (row: PipelineRow, to: string) => void; dismissError: () => void; settle: (token: number) => void; reset: () => void }
export function usePipelineMove(kind: PipelineKind, onSaved: (move: PipelineMove) => void): PipelineMoveState;
// PipelineCard.tsx, PipelineColumn.tsx, PipelineBoard.tsx: see the code

Then:
1. `src/pages/pipelines/testPages.tsx`: add `import { Board } from './Board';` and, after the `/pipelines/list` route, a `/pipelines/board` route rendering `<><Board /><Where /></>`.
2. `src/App.tsx`: replace `import { PipelinesPage } from './pages/pipelines/PipelinesPage';` with `import { Board as PipelinesBoard } from './pages/pipelines/Board';`, and `<Route path="board" element={<PipelinesPage view="board" />} />` with `<Route path="board" element={<PipelinesBoard />} />`. Keep `<Route index element={<Navigate to="list" replace />} />`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the Board, List and move tests**

Run: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 src/components/pipelines/portfolio src/pages/pipelines/Board.test.tsx src/pages/pipelines/List.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 8: Typecheck, lint and commit**

Run: `npx tsc -b && npx eslint src/pages/pipelines src/components/pipelines src/App.tsx`

```bash
git add src/components/pipelines/portfolio src/pages/pipelines/Board.tsx src/pages/pipelines/Board.test.tsx src/pages/pipelines/testPages.tsx src/App.tsx
git commit -m "feat(pipelines): the stage Board, with Closed Lost collapsed and moves saved on the item

### Task 12: Retire the old page and the dead tab; the house rules over the new files

**Files:**
- Delete: `src/pages/pipelines/PipelinesPage.tsx`, `src/pages/pipelines/PipelinesPage.test.tsx`
- Delete: `src/components/shared/PipelinesTab.tsx`, `src/components/shared/PipelinesTab.test.tsx`
- Modify: `src/components/shared/index.ts` (the two `PipelinesTab` export lines)
- Modify: `src/components/organizations/detail/alignment.test.tsx` (the `PipelinesTab` import, `PIPELINE_PROPS`, the `PipelinesTab` test)
- Modify: comments that still name the removed files (`src/components/pipelines/*`, `src/features/customers/customersSlice.ts`)
- Create: `src/components/pipelines/portfolio/houseRules.test.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `houseRuleSuite` (`src/test/houseRules.ts`).
- Produces: nothing new. With the old page go the Count/MRR toggle, the stat-card banner, the `<table>` list, the client-side filter popover and the client totals (spec §1 "Removed").

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the house-rules suite (it fails until Tasks 6–11 are in; they are)**

```ts
// src/components/pipelines/portfolio/houseRules.test.ts
import { houseRuleSuite } from '../../../test/houseRules';

// The Pipelines portfolio (spec 2026-09-30 §1): its components and its two
// pages. The older forms and KanbanBoard beside this folder predate the
// house rules and are not scanned (as on Organizations).
houseRuleSuite('pipelines portfolio house rules', {
  ...(import.meta.glob('./*.tsx', { query: '?raw', eager: true, import: 'default' }) as Record<string, string>),
  ...(import.meta.glob(['../../../pages/pipelines/List.tsx', '../../../pages/pipelines/Board.tsx'], {
    query: '?raw',
    eager: true,
    import: 'default',
  }) as Record<string, string>),
});
```

Run: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 src/components/pipelines/portfolio/houseRules.test.ts`
Expected: PASS. A failure names the file and the rule; fix the file, not the rule.

- [ ] **Step 2: Remove the dead tab's test case from the alignment suite**

In `src/components/organizations/detail/alignment.test.tsx`:
1. Delete `import { PipelinesTab } from '../../shared/PipelinesTab';`.
2. Delete the `const PIPELINE_PROPS = { … };` block.
3. Delete the whole `it('PipelinesTab: embedded has no scroll area, padding or max width; the default is unchanged', () => { … });`.
4. Rename the `describe('People and Deals & risks render flush, other routes keep their inset', …)` to `describe('People renders flush, other routes keep their inset', …)`. Its ContactsTab test is unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 3: Delete the old page and the dead tab**

```bash
git rm src/pages/pipelines/PipelinesPage.tsx src/pages/pipelines/PipelinesPage.test.tsx src/components/shared/PipelinesTab.tsx src/components/shared/PipelinesTab.test.tsx
```

In `src/components/shared/index.ts`, delete:

```ts
export { PipelinesTab } from './PipelinesTab';
export type { PipelinesTabProps } from './PipelinesTab';
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Point the comments that named them at what replaced them**

```bash
grep -rln "PipelinesTab\|PipelinesPage" src | xargs sed -i '' \
  -e 's#components/shared/PipelinesTab\.tsx#components/organizations/detail/DealsTab.tsx#g' \
  -e 's#PipelinesTab\.tsx#organizations/detail/DealsTab.tsx#g' \
  -e 's#PipelinesTab#DealsTab#g' \
  -e 's#pages/pipelines/PipelinesPage\.tsx#pages/pipelines/List.tsx and Board.tsx#g' \
  -e 's#PipelinesPage\.tsx#pages/pipelines/List.tsx and Board.tsx#g' \
  -e 's#PipelinesPage#the Pipelines pages#g'
grep -rn "PipelinesTab\|PipelinesPage" src
```

Expected: the last grep prints nothing. Read the diff (`git diff src/components/pipelines src/features/customers`): only comments changed.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run everything the removals touch**

Run: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 src/components/organizations/detail src/components/shared src/components/pipelines src/pages/pipelines src/pages/organizations src/pages/accounts`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 6: Typecheck, lint and commit**

Run: `npx tsc -b && npm run lint`

```bash
git add -A src/pages/pipelines src/components/shared src/components/organizations/detail/alignment.test.tsx src/components/pipelines src/features/customers/customersSlice.ts
git commit -m "refactor(pipelines): retire the old page, its table and banner, and the unused PipelinesTab

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Task 13: The end-to-end journey and the product documents

**Files:**
- Create: `src/e2e/pipelines.test.tsx`
- Modify: `docs/03-ui-ux-design.md` (the component inventory's portfolio and `KanbanBoard` rows; a new "Portfolio rows and board (Pipelines)" section before "Account page"; the focus-trap debt list)
- Modify: `docs/04-app-flow.md` (the route table's `/pipelines/{list,board}` row; §4.5 Pipelines)
- Modify: `.agents/workflows/repo-architecture.md` (the tree, the route map, the portfolio file table, §10 Pipelines, the organization page's "Other tabs")

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `renderPipelines` (Tasks 10–11), `stubPipelines`, `pipelineBulkBodies`, `recordWrites`.
- Produces: the journey and the documents.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the journey**

```tsx

Run: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2 src/e2e/pipelines.test.tsx`
Expected: PASS.

- [ ] **Step 2: `docs/03-ui-ux-design.md`**

1. In the component inventory, append to the "Portfolio rows and board" row: `The primitives they share with Pipelines (usePagedRead, tileParts, filterParts, ChipRow, MoveToMenu, useSearchText, SelectionActionsBar) live in the same folder.` Add a row after it:

```markdown
| Pipelines book (`components/pipelines/portfolio/`) | `/pipelines/list` and `/pipelines/board`: `PipelineItem` (a rounded item: title, Part of, MRR, stage, priority, department, date line, one signal), `PipelineSections`, `PipelineTiles` (with the open-stage strip), `PipelineToolbar`/`PipelineFilters`, `PipelineBoard`/`PipelineColumn`/`PipelineCard`, `PipelineKindSwitch`, `PipelineModals`. Its own kinds (`OPPORTUNITIES_KIND`, `RISKS_KIND`), on the shared portfolio primitives. See "Portfolio rows and board (Pipelines)" below |
```

2. Change the `KanbanBoard` row's "used by Pipelines" to "used by the Deals & risks tabs' board (organisation and account pages)".
3. Before `### Account page (`/accounts/:id`)`, add:

```markdown
### Portfolio rows and board (Pipelines)

`/pipelines/list` and `/pipelines/board` are one book of opportunities or
risks across organisations and accounts (spec
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-pipelines-redesign-design.md` §1), read
from `GET /pipelines/{opportunities,risks}/`. They look and behave like the
Organizations and Accounts portfolios, with their own kinds (`PipelineKind`:
`OPPORTUNITIES_KIND`, `RISKS_KIND` in `features/pipelines/pipelineKinds.ts`)
because a pipeline item has no health, lifecycle or ARR:

- The top bar is the framed one: "Pipelines", List | Board keeping the query,
  and Opportunities | Risks (`?kind=risks`; opportunities when absent). Below
  `sm` the kind switch is the page's first row instead. The actions slot waits
  for Ask (delivery 2); there is no rail yet.
- Five tiles, every figure the server's over every filtered row (the stage
  filter is the only one they ignore): Open pipeline / MRR at risk (a figure,
  count · MRR), Closing / Due within 30 or 90 days, Overdue, Won / Mitigated
  this quarter, and a strip of the open stages. Each but the first sets its
  filter and clears it when pressed again.
- An item is never a table row: the title (it opens the Opportunity or Risk
  form), "Part of" the organisation or account as a link (and an account's
  organisation), MRR in the workspace's currency, the stage tag, priority,
  department ("Whole company" when blank), the date line ("Closes in 12d",
  "Overdue 5d" in danger, "No date"; risks "Due in 12d"; a closed item past its
  date "Expected 5 Sep 2026") and at most one signal (Overdue, else High
  priority on an open item, which then stands in for the priority tag). In a
  narrow column the facts wrap under the title; targets are 44px on phones.
- Group by stage (the default on both views), close / due month (Overdue,
  the months, No date), organisation or account, owner (named people, "Not
  in your book", Unassigned), department or priority; the List also offers
  None. Sort by MRR, date, priority, stage or title. Filters: owner,
  organisation, account, stage (the List's default is the open stages, the
  Board's every stage), priority, department and the date windows. Everything
  is in the URL.
- Selection (the List only) offers Set stage, Set priority, Set department
  and Set date (a date, or Clear date), each armed and applied with "Apply to
  N", and Export selected.
- The Board has a column per stage; Closed Lost starts collapsed ("Show
  Closed Lost") and stays a drop target. Dragging a card (from `sm`) or its
  Move to… menu saves the item's stage; a card opens its form.
- The organisation and account pages' Deals & risks items gain the same date
  line and the Overdue signal; both forms gain the date ("Expected close" /
  "Due by") and Closed Lost.
```

4. In the focus-trap debt item, replace `` `PipelinesPage`, `` with nothing (the page is gone; the forms it opened are listed under their own names elsewhere).

- [ ] **Step 3: `docs/04-app-flow.md`**

1. Route table: replace the row `| `/pipelines/{list,board}` | `PipelinesPage` | auth |` with

```markdown
| `/pipelines/{list,board}` | `PipelinesList`, `PipelinesBoard` (`pages/pipelines/List.tsx`, `Board.tsx`): one book of opportunities or risks across organisations and accounts, `?kind=risks` for risks; `/pipelines` redirects to the List | auth |
```

2. Replace §4.5's body with:

```markdown
1. `/pipelines/list` reads `GET /pipelines/{opportunities|risks}/` (the kind
   from `?kind=`, opportunities when absent):
   - Its state is in the URL: `kind, search, organisation, account, owner
     (id|unassigned|outside), stage, priority, department (none = whole
     company), date (30|90|180|overdue|none), changed (quarter), ids, sort,
     group`. `group` defaults to stage; `group=none` turns grouping off. With
     no `stage` the server lists the open stages.
   - A `limit=1` frame read gives the tiles, groups, filter options, count and
     currency; each open section reads its own rows with `group_value`; with a
     filter on, a `limit=1` probe gives M for "N of M opportunities".
   - Selecting items offers Set stage, priority, department and date through
     `POST /pipelines/<kind>/bulk/`; a failure is named per item and stays
     selected. Export sends the view's query, or `ids`, to
     `GET /pipelines/<kind>/export.csv`.
2. `/pipelines/board` uses the same state; with no `stage` it asks for every
   stage. A move is `PATCH /opportunities/<id>/` or `/risks/<id>/` with the
   new `stage`, then the frame and the two columns it touched read again.
3. An item or card opens `OpportunityFormModal` / `RiskFormModal`, built from
   its row. Save PATCHes `/opportunities/<id>/` (or `/risks/<id>/`), Delete
   confirms and DELETEs; Add reads `GET /customers/` for its organisation
   picker, then `GET /customers/<id>/accounts/`, and POSTs `/opportunities/`
   (or `/risks/`) with `customer_id` or `account_id`. The page reads its book
   again after each.
4. Opportunities | Risks keeps the view and the shared filters and drops
   `stage`, `changed` and `ids`. Ask on Pipelines is delivery 2.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: `.agents/workflows/repo-architecture.md`**

1. Tree: under `components/`, after the `accounts/detail/` line, add
   `│   │   ├── pipelines/          ← OpportunityFormModal, RiskFormModal, KanbanBoard (the Deals & risks board); portfolio/ holds the Pipelines book's parts`;
   under `features/`, add `│   │   ├── pipelines/          ← the Pipelines book: types, API, kinds (OPPORTUNITIES_KIND, RISKS_KIND), URL state, chips`;
   under `pages/`, change `pipelines/          ← Pipelines board + list view` to `pipelines/          ← List and Board (one book of opportunities or risks)`.
2. Route map: replace the three `pipelines/` lines with

```
└── pipelines/
    ├── (index)                → Redirects to /pipelines/list
    ├── list                   → PipelinesList (List.tsx on GET /pipelines/<kind>/, ?kind=risks)
    └── board                  → PipelinesBoard (Board.tsx: stage columns, moves PATCH the item)
```

3. Portfolio file table: add

```markdown
| `components/organizations/portfolio/{usePagedRead,tileParts,filterParts,MoveToMenu,useSearchText,SelectionActionsBar}` | The shape-agnostic parts the Organizations, Accounts and Pipelines books share: the cursor-paged read, tiles, the Filters sheet and fields, the Move to… menu, the debounced search box, the selection bar with any choices and a date |
| `features/pipelines/*`, `components/pipelines/portfolio/*` | The Pipelines book: `pipelineTypes`, `pipelineApi`, `pipelineKinds` (`OPPORTUNITIES_KIND`, `RISKS_KIND`, date line, row → form record), `pipelineParams`, `pipelineChips`; `PipelineItem`, `PipelineSections`, `PipelineTiles`, `PipelineToolbar`, `PipelineFilters`, `PipelineBoard`, `PipelineColumn`, `PipelineCard`, `PipelineKindSwitch`, `PipelineModals`, `usePipelineBook`, `usePipelineMove`, `usePipelineForms`; `features/pipelines/testPipelines.ts` (`stubPipelines`) and `pages/pipelines/testPages.tsx` (`renderPipelines`) for tests |
```

4. Replace §10's body with: "One book of opportunities or risks across organisations and accounts (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-30-pipelines-redesign-design.md`): the portfolio design (tiles with an open-stage strip, URL filters, list items with Part of and a date line, selection with bulk stage / priority / department / date, export) and a stage Board whose moves PATCH the item. See `docs/03-ui-ux-design.md` "Portfolio rows and board (Pipelines)"." and retitle it `### 10. Pipelines (`pages/pipelines/List.tsx`, `Board.tsx`)`.
5. In the organization page's **Other tabs** line, change `DealsTab` (`PipelinesTab`) to `DealsTab` (items with the date line and Overdue; `KanbanBoard` from `sm`); in the dependency graph change `shared/PipelinesTab` to `detail/DealsTab`; in the Organizations board paragraph change "`KanbanBoard` is no longer used here (Pipelines keeps it)" to "`KanbanBoard` is no longer used here (the Deals & risks tabs keep it)".

- [ ] **Step 5: Format and commit**

Run: `npx prettier --check docs/03-ui-ux-design.md docs/04-app-flow.md .agents/workflows/repo-architecture.md || true` (the docs are not prettier-gated here; keep the existing line style).

```bash
git add src/e2e/pipelines.test.tsx docs/03-ui-ux-design.md docs/04-app-flow.md .agents/workflows/repo-architecture.md
git commit -m "docs(pipelines): the book in the product documents, and its end-to-end journey

### Task 14: Final verification

**Files:** none new.

- [ ] **Step 1: The whole suite, one process**

Run: `npx vitest run --maxWorkers=2`
Expected: every file passes, the Organizations, Accounts and Deals & risks suites with their assertions unchanged (`git diff origin/main --stat -- src/pages/organizations src/pages/accounts src/components/organizations/detail/DealsTab.test.tsx` shows no test edits there; `DealItem.test.tsx` only gains one test; `alignment.test.tsx` only loses the dead tab's).

- [ ] **Step 2: Types, lint, build**

Run: `npx tsc -b && npm run lint && npm run build`
Expected: no errors (the existing `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` warnings in the forms are the known ones).

- [ ] **Step 3: Nothing left of the old page**

Run: `grep -rn "PipelinesPage\|PipelinesTab\|TabPill\|applyFilters(" src`
Expected: no output.

- [ ] **Step 4: The anti-slop bar on the new files**

Run: `grep -nE "#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}\b|rgba?\(|text-\[(1[024]|12|14|16|18)(\.5)?px\]|h-screen" src/components/pipelines/portfolio/*.tsx src/pages/pipelines/*.tsx src/components/organizations/portfolio/{tileParts,filterParts,MoveToMenu,SelectionActionsBar}.tsx`
Expected: no output.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit any fix** the steps above needed, with a message naming it (`fix(pipelines): …`).

---

### Task 15: Browser check, then finishing the branch

**Files:** none (a fix found here gets its own commit).

- [ ] **Step 1: Run the app against the backend branch**

The backend `feat/pipelines-portfolio` must be running locally with its migration applied and demo opportunities and risks seeded (`seed_demo_opportunities`, `seed_demo_risks`; set a few `expected_close` / `due_by` values in the admin so the tiles and the Overdue line have data). Start the frontend with `npm run dev` and sign in as an admin, then as a CSM limited to one department.

- [ ] **Step 2: Check at 1440px, light and dark** (claude-in-chrome or playwright-cli; screenshots into the PR)

- `/pipelines/list`: the bar reads Pipelines · List | Board · Opportunities | Risks, no avatar; five tiles; the stage strip lists only open stages; items are rounded rows with Part of links, the date line (an overdue one in danger), one signal; sections by stage with count · MRR; the Filters popover; a chip per filter; "N of M".
- A tile toggles its filter; the kind switch keeps the owner filter; `?kind=risks` reads "MRR at risk", "Due within", "Mitigated this quarter".
- Select two items: Set stage / priority / department / date and Export selected; a failure is named.
- Click an item: the form shows Expected close (risks: Due by) and Closed Lost; save; the item's date line changes.
- `/pipelines/board`: every stage a column, Closed Lost collapsed; drag a card and use Move to…; a failed move (edit the item away in another tab) comes back with the reason; group by priority: no Move to….
- The organisation page and an account page, Deals & risks tab: each item has the date line; an overdue one says Overdue.
- Dark mode: every surface is a token (no light-only greys), the Overdue tone reads on both.

- [ ] **Step 3: Check at 375px**

One column; the kind switch leads the page; tiles swipe sideways and the page never does; the toolbar is Search, Filters and Select; the Filters sheet holds group, sort, Export and Add; item facts wrap under the title; every control is at least 44px; the Board shows column tabs and one panel at a time, with Move to… and no drag.

- [ ] **Step 4: Finish the branch**

Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch. The merge order is fixed: **the backend PR (`feat/pipelines-portfolio`) merges and deploys first**, then this frontend PR, whose description links it, lists the Decisions above for the owner, and carries the 1440/375 screenshots in both themes. End the PR description with the attribution line the session asks for.

## Self-review

**Spec coverage** (spec §1, §4, §5 frontend and the three backend rulings):

| Requirement | Task |
|---|---|
| Framed bar: Pipelines, List \| Board, Opportunities \| Risks, actions slot, bell; content scrolls; empty rail slot; routes kept; `?kind=` | 10 (Navbar, DashboardLayout, `PipelineKindSwitch`, `OrganizationsFrame` without a rail) |
| Tiles for both kinds, clickable, toggling; totals over every filtered row; tiles ignore only stage; strip shows open stages from `summary.stages` | 8 |
| Search (title, organisation or account name), Group (incl. close month order, owner with outside/Unassigned), Sort, Filters (organisation, account, owner incl. outside, stage open by default, priority, department, date windows, overdue, no date), everything in the URL | 5, 9 |
| Export CSV, + Add, selection with bulk Set stage / priority / department / date | 4 (API), 3 (bar), 10 |
| List items never a table; Part of link; MRR in workspace currency; stage, priority, department; the date line in both kinds' words; one signal | 6, 7 |
| Clicking an item opens the existing form with the date and Closed Lost | 6 (forms), 10 (`PipelineModals`, `opportunityRecord`) |
| Phones: one column, facts wrap under the title, 44px | 7, 9, 10, 11, 15 |
| Board: stage columns, Closed Lost collapsed, cards like items, drag sets stage | 11 |
| Add: organisation or account, title, MRR, stage, priority, department, date | 6, 10 (Decision 7) |
| Removed: Count/MRR toggle, banner, `<table>` lists, client filter popover and totals, `PipelinesTab` with its tests | 10 (routes), 12 |
| Deals & risks: date line and Overdue; forms gain date and Closed Lost | 6 |
| Tests: units for rows, tiles, params; integration with contract-shaped fetch; a jsdom journey; house rules; Organizations/Accounts/Deals & risks still pass | 1–13, 14 |
| Delivery order: backend merges and deploys first | 15 |

Ask on Pipelines (§3) is delivery 2 and out of scope; the frame's actions slot and rail slot are left for it.

**Placeholder scan:** every code step carries its code; no "TBD", "similar to", or unnamed helper.

**Type consistency:** `PipelineKind.fetch` is a property (a stable reader for `usePagedRead`); `PipelineParams` and `pipelineApiQuery(p, view, extra)` are used with the same names in Tasks 5, 7, 9, 10 and 11; `PipelineMove` / `PipelineColumnSpec` (Task 11) are the Board's only move types; `BulkChoice` / `CLEAR_DATE` (Task 3) are what the List imports; `withArticle` lives in `pipelineKinds.ts` (Task 4) for Tasks 7 and 11.
