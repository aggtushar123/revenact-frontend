// Two roles only: a monochrome scale for anything that isn't a status (ink,
// muted, faint — the same three tones as `text-primary`/`text-secondary`/
// `text-tertiary`), and the three semantic tokens for when a value really is
// a loss, a gain or a caution. Nothing here is a literal colour — every
// value is a CSS custom property so light/dark mode and any future
// palette change apply everywhere at once. `chartPalette.test.ts` scans the
// whole dashboard and health tree for the alternative (a literal colour) and
// fails the build if one shows up.

/** The monochrome/semantic roles every chart in this app draws from. Prefer
 *  `ink`/`muted`/`faint` for anything that is a category rather than a
 *  status — a source, an area, a segment — so danger/success/warning stay
 *  reserved for their one job: loss, gain and caution.
 *
 *  `inkStrong`/`inkSoft`/`gainSoft` exist because some charts need more
 *  distinct values than `ink`/`muted`/`faint` (three tones) can cover
 *  without two categories in the same chart landing on the same colour —
 *  a stacked bar with five statuses, a scatter with six usage bands. Each
 *  is a `color-mix()` of a role colour with the surface it sits on, so it
 *  stays a genuine intermediate step (not a fourth arbitrary hue) and still
 *  resolves correctly in dark mode, where `--bg-surface` flips too. */
