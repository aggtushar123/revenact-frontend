/**
 * The renewal book, read as money rather than as accounts.
 *
 * Every other Health Overview tab counts accounts. This one counts dollars,
 * because a renewal is a revenue event: twelve healthy logos renewing next
 * quarter and one shaky one worth more than all of them is a good quarter with
 * a problem in it, and a chart of account counts says the opposite.
 *
 * The Movement tab's renewal runway is deliberately not this. That one answers
 * "how many accounts renew when, and how healthy are they" as context for a
 * trend; this answers "what is the money, where is it exposed, and who has to
 * act on it this month".
 *
 * ## Rows with no ARR
 *
 * `arr` is null when the customer's contract currency has no exchange rate
 * configured, so the backend refused to guess (see the health endpoint). Those
 * rows are counted in the *account* figures and left out of every *money*
 * figure, and each total reports how many it left out. The alternative —
 * treating an unconverted amount as if it were already in the reporting
 * currency — produces a confident wrong number, which is the one outcome worse
 * than an incomplete one.
