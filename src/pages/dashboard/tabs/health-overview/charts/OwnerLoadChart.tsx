 * accounts and one shaky large one don't look the same — they aren't.
 *
 * Hand-drawn bars rather than Recharts. Each row is one number against one
 * scale with a label on either side; a charting library would add an axis, a
 * tooltip and a container height for a layout that is two divs and a
 * percentage.
 *
 * Each row is a real `<button>` rather than a chart segment behind a hidden
 * `DrillTargets` list — unlike the Recharts bars elsewhere on this tab, a
 * plain HTML bar is already reachable by mouse and keyboard alike once it is
 * an interactive element.
