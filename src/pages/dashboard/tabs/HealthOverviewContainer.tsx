 * source of truth for the bar's three filters — `DashboardToolbar` reads
 * and writes it — and this container mirrors it into `state.health` on every
 * change, because the views and their tests already read filters from Redux.
 * URL `customer` is Redux `account`: both are a customer id.
 *
 * The copy is exact (`replaceHealthFilters`, no pruning): a deep link can
 * arrive before the book does, and pruning against no rows would drop every
 * filter in Redux while the URL, the chips and the Clear count still showed
 * it. A combination the loaded book cannot honour is fixed in the URL itself,
 * so every reader of the URL — chips, Clear, other areas — agrees.
