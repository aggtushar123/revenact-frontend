// display names the API returns.
//
// Colour lives here rather than in the payload because that is what
// every other real-data chart in this app already does — see
// SurveyTrendChart's own LINES and HealthDistribution's category map. Only the
// mock this replaced shipped `fill` alongside its numbers, which meant
// the backend had an opinion about the theme.
//
// Both maps are keyed by label, not by the raw enum value, because
// that's what the charts stack, legend and tooltip by.
//
// The actual colours and axis helpers live in the dashboard-wide
// `shared/chartPalette.ts` now — re-exported here so every chart in this tab
// keeps importing from `./chartTheme` rather than reaching across tabs.
