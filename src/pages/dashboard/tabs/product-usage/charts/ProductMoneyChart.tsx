 * The screen's thesis in one chart: per product, money held in healthy
 * accounts, money held in accounts that are not, and money already gone.
 *
 * Three segments because a single ARR bar per product answers the easy
 * question — which product is biggest — and hides the one worth asking. A
 * product can be the largest on the book and still be the one leaking: that
 * shows up here as a tall bar made mostly of the two darker segments.
 *
 * The churned segment is stacked on *beside* the live ones rather than
 * included in them: it is not revenue, it is revenue that left. Showing it in
 * the same bar is the point — a product's past is the best available evidence
 * about its present.
